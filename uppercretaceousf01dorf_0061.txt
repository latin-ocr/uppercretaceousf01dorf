Family CANNACEAE
Genus CANNA Linnc

Canna cf. O? magnisona Knowlton
(Plate 2, Fig. 5)

The single incomplcte specimen figured is the only one of this kind in the collections. It is
evidently closely related to Canna? muym'solia and Cannu? sp. from the Vermcjo formation.¹
The only apparent difference is the absence of the faint alternation of thick and thin veins shown
in Knowlton‘s figures and in the type specimens. Berry has reported fragments comparablc to
the same species from the Lance formation of South Dakotass I have scen Berry’s specimens at
the U. S. National Museum and find them indistinguishable from the observable features of the
Medicine Bow specimen.

Among living forms this type of leaf has been found to bear a general resemblance to the
leaves of Musa and Heliconia of the Musaceae, M arama and Thalia of the Marantaceae, and
Canna of the Cannaceae. The uniform thickness of the numerous vcins in the fossil specimens
resembles most closely the leaves of Canna and Thalia.

nym, Heer, 1856.)

The fragment figured is the only identifiable specimen of this type in the collectione. It is
clearly marked by parallel veins, the heavier ones about 1.5 to 2 mm. apart, with the lighter ones
intermediate and numbering 5 to 7 between each heavier pair. These venation characters are
similar to those of the specimens of Zz‘nyiber'z'tes dubius from the Denver formation.

Both Lesquereux and Knowlton rightfully regarded this species as of doubtful taxonomic
status. It is unfortunate that more complete specimens have not been found to add to the
knowledge of its leaf form and characteristics.
