So few specimens of Cretaceous or Tertiary representatives of Typha have been described or
identified specifically that there is nothing to be gained in describing the Medicine Bow specimens
as a new species. From the environmental point of view, however, the presence of this common
type of aquatic monocotyledon is of significance.

Family PANDANACEAE
Genus PANDANITES Dorf, n. gen.

This generic name is proposed for specimens with the characteristics of the following type
species. The name is derived from the family Pandanaceae, whose members possess spirally
arranged linear leaves which are leathery‚ keeled, and mostly spinulose on the margins and keel.²

Pandanites corsom' Dor-f, n. sp.
(Plate 3, Fig. 4)

Only the single specimen figured was encountered in the collections. I was at first inclined
to regard this as the impression of a portion of a palm leaf . After careful study of all the available
living and herbarium specimens of palms at The New York Botanical Garden, I was convinced
that none of these was comparable to the fossil. It soon became apparent that its characters were
very similar to those of the Pandanaceae.

Descrz'ption—Leaf of unknown length, width 5 cm.‚ texture evidently leathery; prominent
central keel, and each half of leaf marked by a subsidiary central dorsal keel; leaf surface marked
by 40 to 46 longitudinal‚ parallel veins which are irregularly connected by transverse veinlets
which may be perpendicular or oblique to the veins; margins of leaf invested with strongly spinose
teeth about 5 to 6 mm. apart.

The usual description of the leaves of the Pandanaceae emphasizes that both the leaf edges
and the central keel are spinulose. In living specimens of Pandanus, however, I have noticed
that the keel is perfectly smooth in the basal half of the leaves, becoming spinulose only in the
distal half. The absence of teeth‚ therefore, in the fossil specimen is not considered of taxonomic
importance. It is doubtful, moreover, whether spines along the keel would be discernible in a flat
fossil impression.

The modern Pandanaceae are represented in the tropics and subtropics of the Old World by
three genera: Sararanqa Hemsl. (Solomon Islands) ; F reycz'fnetia Gaudich (East Indies to Australia
and New Zealand) ; and Pandanus Linne (Asia and Africa). They are usually found in lowland
marshes or along sea-coasts and are not known to occur under typically temperate conditions.

There are no fossil specimens known to me which are comparable to Pandam’tes corsoni.
There is a superficial resemblance in Bactrites pandam‘solz'us Berry from the Eocene Lisbon forma-
tion of Mississippi.² This, however, is typically a fiat leaf, with a single prominent midrib and
longer tecth.

This species is named for Mr. Andrew Corson, who was instrumental in the original dis-
covery of fossil leaves on his property.

Family CYPERACEAE

Genus CYPERACITES Schimper
Cyperacites sp.
(Plate 1, Fig. 11)
There are a number of specimens in the collections which are quite obviously monocotyle-

donous leaves with venation characters unlike those referred to Typha. As shown in the figured
specimen they are long, 8 to 12 mm. wide, and provided with numerous fine, parallel veins about
