nensis, which Sanborn, at about the same date,¹ considered more appropriately referred to the
genus Aralia. It seems to 1110 that the species might equally well be a Viburnmn. In my private
herbarium Ι have a number of leaves of the Asiatic Viburnum 501110ῑεί11ἓέ, whose characters, particu-
larly of venation and marginal 100111, appear to be more like those of the fossil specimens than are
those of any Aralia. In the range of size and shape variations, moreover, these Viburnum leaves
can exactly match the variations seen 111 1110 leaves of Celastrus taurinensis and its synonymous
forms. In view of the scarcity of leaves of this type 111 1110 Medicine Bow 001100110115, however,
it does not seem desirable to make further changes in the taxonomy, but rather await the revision
of the Fort Union flora by Dr. Roland W. Brown, who has a large suite of specimens of 11115 speeies
at his disposal at the U. S. National Museum.

This species is evidently widespread and of long geologic range in North America. In
addition to its recorded occurrences, there are also several perfect specimens of it in the unclassified
material from Black Buttes, Wyoming, which Ι have consulted at the U. S. National Museum.
It is one of the few Medicine Bow species which ranges up into the Fort Union of the Rocky
Mountain region. As seen in the citations above, it is also common in the Eocene of the Gulf
Coast and of Oregon. Any attempt to separate the late Cretaceous forms from those of the
Paleocene and Eocene on justifiable grounds has been futile, although the Cretaceous specimens do
seem to 110 111010 1311ρο01310 111 average shape. Whether or not this character can become the basis
for specific separation remains 10 110 50011 111 subsequent studies.

Lanceolate leaves, referable to Rhamnus salicisolius, are abundant and widespread in the
Medicine Bow formation. More than 20 well-preserved specimens in 1110 001100110115 indicate
considerable variation in size, yet are identical 111 seeondary and tertiary venation and general
shape. The average characteristics are precisely as shown in Lesquereux⁷s original figures,²
except that the reconstruction of the broken tip of his figure 9 should apparently have been con-
siderably elongated. In view of the intergrading variations observed in the Medicine Bow speci-
mens, it is evident that the species listed above as synonyrnous are merely slight variants of the
average leaf form of Rhamnes saliciffolius. It seems desirable 10 re-describe this species on the
basis of the abundant material collected.

Description (Supplementary)—Leaves typically narrowly lanceolate, narrowing gradually
from below the middle to an elongate acute tip, and more abruptly below to 311 equilateral or
slightly inequilateral cuneate base, length 5 to 12 cm., width 1.5 to 25 0111., average dimensions
apparently about 10 by 2 cm., petiole short, thin, up to 1 cm. long; midrib firm, relatively straight ;
10 to 14 pairs of thin, mainly alternate secondaries leaving the midrib at angles of 25Ο 10 450, curv-
ing uniformly upward toward the margins, converging, unbranched, paralleling margins and
