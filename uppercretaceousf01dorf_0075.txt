Fox HILLs ΛΝΒ LOWER MEDICINE now 63

recently found this species in the Colgate formation of eastern Montana. I have compared the
Medicine Bow specimens with both the original type specimens and the Colgatc specimvns and
find them all alike in essential characteristic-s.

The reference to the genus Magynolzssa may be correct, though as yet [insubstantiated by asso-
ciated seeds, flowers, or wood. I have seen no modern leaves closely resembling these specimcns.

Magnolia dakotana Berry

There are 6 specimens of this type, of which the best is figured. Except for the slight ab·
normality in the basal venation of the figure-d type, it is difficnlt to differentiate between the Lance
and Medicine Bow specimens. Despite the well-defined characters of this species, there appear
to be no other fossil forms with which a comparison can be made. Berry's reference to the genus
M aqnolc'a was made with some hesitation. At present it seems (lesirable to retain it there pending

Magnolia nervosa (Knowlton) Brown

Pterospermites nervosus Knowlton, U. S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Paper 101, 273, pl. 48, fig. 4, 1917.

This type of leaf is rare in the Medieine Bow collections, being represented only by a few
fragments and the single fairly complete leaf figured. This specimen is identical with those from
the Colgate and lower Lance formatione of eastern Montana which are in the collections of the
U. S. National Museum. Brown has referred these to Μ aynolz'a nervosa, with which he has syn-
onymized the specimen of Pterospermites ‘nervosus from the Vermejo formation.

Magnolia pulchra Ward
(Plate 11, Fig. 8)

MaqnzlJIiZSpglchrg {Valrglg7ss S. Geol. Surv., eth Ann. Rept.‚ 556, pl. 60, figs. 2, 3, 1886; idem, Bun. 37, 103,

This species is represented only by several fragmentary leaves and the nearly complete
specimen figured. It is identical in all respects with the type and figured specimen of M aqnozia
pulchra, except possibly for the tip, which is turned under in the Medicine Bow specimen but ap-
pears to be slightly more obtuse. The obovate shape and thin secondaries clearly distinguish this
species fron] the others referred to the same genus.

The original specimens of this species are from the' Mesaverde formation. Berry has recently
reported it from the upper Ravenscrag (Fort Union) of southern Saskatchewan.1 I have not
been able to see his specimens for comparison‚ so cannot comment on their relationship to the
late Cretaceous specimens.

The generic reference to M aqualia seems reasonable. I have noted also a resemblance of the
specimens to the leaves of Asimina triloba Dunal (Anonaceae), which are identical in shape and
size and differ only slightly in their more regular secondary veins.
