becoming indistinet 91059 to the leaf borders; tertiaries thin, percurrent at angles approaehing 900
to the plane of the midrib; finer nervation not preserve(l; margin entire throughout; tvxture firm.

This speeies appears to be most abundant in the Laramie and Medis-ine Bow sorniations.
It is evidently less abundant though definitely present 111 the Vermejo and Black Buttes floras,
and is questionably identified in the Denver and Dawson ssoras. Its reported occurrence in the
Lance formationl seems likely, though as yet unsubstantiated by figured speeimens. To 1ny
knowledge there are no reported oeeurrenees of leaves of this type from formations of indisputable
Paleocene or later age.

The leaves of this fossil species are, in my opinion, distinetly not rhamnaceous. Ι have
studied all available herbarium material of the genera of tho Rhamnaeeae at The New York
Botanical Garden and failed to find a comparable leaf type. Several genera os the Lauraccae, on
the other hand, are very similar in most details. Persea lanceolata has leaves of the same general
shape and venation. Even closer 1119 the leaves of Nectmzdra pic-hurz'm (HBK.) Μ91,.,2 os
northern South America, and N. membranacea (S.W.) Griesb.,³ of Central America, which possess
the same well-defined secondary and tertiary venation and the same variations 111 size and shape
as the fossil specimens.

This type of leaf is one of the more abundant and widespread in the Medicine Bow collections.
It is remarkably consistent in the majority of its observable characters, being particularly so in
its secondary and tertiary venation. The average leaf specimen is identieal with the original type
speeimens of Rhammms clebzcrtzi from the Denver formation. In studying the large number of
leaves of this type in my collection, however, it has become apparent that the leaves are somewhat
more variable, as one would expect, than Lesquereux's description and figures might imply. The
two specimens here figured were chosen to show such variations rat-her than the average type. In
figure 5, for example, is shown a somewhat more lanceolate leaf than the average, whose upper
margin is invested with short, blunt, upward-pointing teeth, identieal with those seen in Les-
quereux's figure os Rhamnus rectinerv'is. The largest specimen obtained is shown in figure 6. This
is somewhat wider above the middle than the average form, and has a more elongate tip; otherwise
it is precisely the same. In view of the range os variations now known it seems desirable to re-
deseribe the speeies as here conceived.
