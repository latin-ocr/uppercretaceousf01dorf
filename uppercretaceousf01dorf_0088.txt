74 CONTRIBUTIONS TO PALAEONTOLOGY

cuneate base; length 5 to 14 cm., width 5 to 11 cm., average dimensions appear to be about 9 by 8
cm.; petiole thick, long, up to 5 cm.; venation palmate, tri-nerved from the top of the petiole,
strong, the midrib straight or slightly zigzag toward the apex, craspedodrome with 4 or 5
pairs of strong, subopposite seeondaries, straight, subparallel, diverging from the midrib at an
angle of 200 to 300, more rarely up to 350 but never higher; two lower pairs of secondaries usually
branched once or twice, the branches passing to the marginal teeth; lateral primaries diverging
at the same angle as the secondaries on the midrib, often slightly longer than secondaries, giving
slightly trilobate character to the leaf; each lateral primary with 4 to 6 acute secondary branches
on its lower side, the lowest of which bears numerous, usually camptodrome branches, while the
upper branehes are unbroken, or often once or twice branched and craspedodrome; branches
occasionally also developed on upper side of lateral primaries near the margins, usually craspedo-
drome: tertiary venation strong, the nervilles both broken and percurrent; margin entire below
to near the middle of the leaf, becoming denticulate above, the teeth small, usually acute, occa-
sionally slightly obtuse3 texture firm.

Lesquereux originally included in Viburnum marqinatum several smaller leaves of quite
different character,¹ which both Knowlton and Berry later agreed should be separated into a new
species. The evidence from the Medicine Bow collections substantiates separation, since the
smaller specimens of V. maminotum (see plate 15, figure 3) are consistently of the same character
as the larger specimens. It is, of course, possible that this speeies may have had two entirely
different leaf forms among the smaller leaves. Whether or not this is probable must remain a
matter of opinion until branches bearing both kinds of smaller leaves be discovered.

From the same locality from which V. marqtnatum was described Lesquereux obtained
several larger specimens of what he called V. plotcrncides. These he distinguished from V. mar-
qz'natmn by the “less numerous, more open, lateral veins, whose branches are more curved in
passing up to the borders, and especially by the enlarged truncate or subtruncate base of the
leaves.” 2 I was at first inclined to regard the leaves of this type as large forms of V. maryz'natum,
but failed to find a single form among the hundreds of Medicine Bow specimens which possessed
the essential characters of V. platanoides. Moreover, the large specimens in the collections main—
tained consistently the diagnostic characters of V. maminotum. It seems evident, therefore, that
these two species are distinct, as Knowlton has previously concluded.³

The abundant material of V. maminotum now available makes it possible to revise the status
of several late Cretaceous specimens referred to various species of Placemus. The specimens which
Ward obtained from the type locality of Viburrzsum marqmatmn and which he referred to the
Dakota species Platonas heeriz' are clearly referable to the former species in every respect. The
Raton and Laramie specimens referred to P. platanoides by Knowlton are easily distinguished
from that species by their cuneate bases, shape, and venation. Ι am also convinced that the
Baton specimens referred to P. ym‘lleZmoe heerii and the Denver specimen referred to P. aceroides
latifolia are indistinguishable from the larger specimens of Viburnum maminotum, which are often
slightly trilobate in shape.

The previous and present record of V. maminotum indicates that it is an extremely wide-
spread, abundant, and easily recognizable species, which is limited stratigraphically to deposits of
latest Cretaceous age. It is unknown from the extensive floras of indisputable Paleocene or later
age of the Rocky Mountain region. It may possibly be present in the Paleocene of Texas.⁴¹ The
exact formation here is in doubt, however, and the specimens (= platanus accroz'dcs latifolia)
have not been figured, making the occurrence of doubtful value.

The generic status of Viburnum maminotum has suffered considerable vacillation between
the genera Viburnum and Plutanus. Lesquereux originally referred the species to Viburnum on
the basis of comparison with the modern V. pubescens Pursh, V. dentatum Linne, and V. {amanoz‘des
Michx. Heer subsequently discovered leaves which he considered conspecific with V. ‘'nar-(linaium
in the Tertiary (Eoccne?) of Unartok, Greenland, and referred the species to Platanus. Heer's
specimens are undeniably platanoid and are closely associated with typical platanoid fruits‚ but
the leaves are clearly different in shape and basal characters from Lesquereux’s specimens, and,
as Hollick has pointed out, “should be regarded not only as speeifically but also as generically
