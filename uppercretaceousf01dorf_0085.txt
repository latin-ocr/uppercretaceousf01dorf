Τ1115 5000105 15 apparently most abundant in the Black Buttcs and Medis-inc Bow floras.
Its reported occurrence in the Lance formation of eastern Wyoming by Knowltonl has been
amply substantiated by his unpublishcd manuscript and figures at the U. S. National Α1111500111.
In the summer of 1936, Ι visited this region and collected several complete specimens clearly
belonging to this same species. Brown has also collected excellent specimens of it in thc Hell
Creek member of the Lance near Marmarth, North Dakota. There (10 not appear to be any other
reported occurrences of the species in North America, although Chancy reports that Cullc'chlamys
zeteki from the upper Eocene (‘?) of Oregon ² is of the same general type.

Except for their resemblance to leaves of the living genus Callichlaaemys, as pointed 0111 hy
Chaney, I have found no other forms except Grezviopsis with which the fossil leaves can be
compared.

The single, nearly complete specimen figured is one of 6 well-preserved specimens of this type
of leaf. It is impossible to distinguish from the Mesaverde specimen referred by VVard to the
European species Cornus studeri. Knowlton has reviewed in detail the status of the various
specimens which have been referred to this species, referring several to Rhamnus cleburm' Les-
quereux.³ He adds, however, that Ward’s Mesaverde specimen and his own specimens from the
same formation are not referable to Rhamnus cleburni nor are they similar to the European Cornus
studeri. With the additional material now at hand it seems advisable to describe the species as
new, despite the indefinite generie reference.

Description—Leaves narrowly ovate to elliptic, gradually narrowed to an extended, slightly
acuminateor acute tip, and more abruptly below to a widely cuneate base; length 7 to 13 em., width
4 to 7 010., widest below the middle, midrib very thick below, tvhinning gradually to the apex;
petiole thick, up to 1.5 cm. long, secondary venation pinnate, mainly alternate, camptodrome;
secondaries more widely spaced along midrib and more abruptly eurved upward in upper half
than in lower half of leaf, outer ends of seeondaries tending to parallel margins for considerable
distance, looping indistinctly with tertiary branches of secondaries next above ; tertiary venation
indistinct, nervilles running mainly at high angle to midrib; margin entire; texture coriaceous.

This species is of the general type of Rhamnus cleburni, though clearly distinguishable by
the more widely spaced, less numerous secondaries, which do not even approach the type of parallel
venation of R. cleburm'. There are also discernible differences in tertiary venation and general
shape. It seems evident, therefore, that Lesquereux’s Denver specimens of Cornus studeri? which
Knowlton identified as Rhamnus cleburnz' belong rather to the type here called Cor-nophyllum warchi.
Also, one of Knowlton’s specimens of Rha-mnus cleburm' from the Denver flora (plate 40, figure 6)
15 clearly referable to Cornophyllum wardii.

In addition to the Medicine Bow occurrences, and its presence in the Mesaverde, Raton, and
Denver formations, this species is also present in my collections of Lance material obtained in
1936 from two localities east and northeast of Lance Creek, Wyoming.

The general shape, entire margin, and secondary venation of this species resemble the leaves
of the living species of Cornus, to which the previously recorded specimens were referred by
