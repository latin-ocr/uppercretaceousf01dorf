Sahal? eocenz'ca Knowlton, U. S. Geol. Surv. Bull. 696, 557, 1919.

The two figured counterparts and a number of fragmentary specimens are identical in every
respect with the specimens originally called Flabellaria eocenica Lesquereux, and are indistinguish-
able from the type and figured specimens of the other species cited above.

Knowlton justifiably included all these species except Sahal? rugosa in his Sabat? eocenica.
In a later report,¹ however, he confused the status of this species by referring it, along with many
others, to Sabalites qrayanus Lesquereux, originally described from the Eocene of Mississippi.²
After an examination of the type specimens of all of these species at the U. S. National Museum,
I am convinced that Knowlton's Sahal? eoce'rznzssca can readily be distinguished by the following
characters: (1) rounded and compressed aspect of the rays near their point of attachment; (2)
number of solds—60 to 80; (3) slightly concave upper surface of the petiole ; (4) truncate to
rounded distal end of the rachis on its upper face, (5) prolongation to 6 to 8 centimeters of the
abruptly narrowed, pointed, distal end of the rachis on its lower face. All the specimens which
Knowlton synonymized with S ,ἲ eocem'ca exhibit this set of characteristics. The type specimen of
Sahal? rugosa, moreover, clearly indicates that it is the upper face of the same species.

In view of the fact that Knowlton questioned the reference to Sahal, it seems advisable to
change the generic name to the less definitive Sabazites. As S. eocem'ca is now conceived, it is
characteristic of the uppermost Cretaceous strata of the Rocky Mountain region, occurring in the
Black Buttes, the lower Raton, the lower Medicine Bow, and the lower Lance floras.³

Genus PALMOCARPON Lesquereux
Palmocarpon? subcylindricum Lesquereux
(Plate 2, Figs. 2, 3)
Pazmocarpon subcylimiricum Lesquereux, Rept. U. S. Geol. Surv. Terr., vol. 7, 121, pl. 11, fig. 12, 1878.

There are three good specimens of this type in the collections. Lesquereux’s description is
as follows:

“F ruit oblong or subcylindrical, truncate at one end, split at the other in two diverging or
slightly recurved, pointed lobes, distantly and obscurely veined toward the base.”

The Medicine Bow specimens fit this description perfectly except that the veining is less
obscure. Comparison with the type specimens at the U. S. National Museum indicated a close
similarity in all characters except size. The veins are definitely not as far apart as Lesquereux's
figures would indicate.

Knowlton has reported additional specimens of this species from the Denver formation and
has questioned the reference to Palmocarpon.‘¹ I have no definite suggestion as yet regarding the
true botanical affinity of the species.
