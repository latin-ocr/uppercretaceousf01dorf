,7 mm. apart; there appears to be a single finer vein between each pair of hcavicr ones; cross veins
are either totally absent or very obscure. Comparable fossil rcmains are usually referred to the
form genus Cypemcnes.

There is very little significance to remains of this type except to record the presence of addi-
tional monocotyledons in the plant association.

The identification of the fossil palm leaves in the collections has led to considerable difficulty.
The large size of the leaves usually makes it impossible to procure perfect or even near-perfect
specimens. After an extended study 01 311 available living and herbarium specimens of palms at
The New York Botanical Garden, Ι 113νο concluded, however, that better taxonomic use can be
made of fossil specimens in which the petiole and the adjoining basal rays are preserved. There
are a number of features which are consistently uniform in any given genus or species and are
consistently different in others. These features include (1) the character of the petiole: whether
unarmed or armed with thorny spines; whether flat, convex, or concave on its upper surface;
whether or not it is prolonged into a rachis; (2) the character of the rachis: short or long; straight,
convex, or coneave sides; (3) the approximate number of rays adjoining the rachis or petiole.
With all of these features preserved, however, it does not seem advisable to refer the fossil forms
to modern genera unless at least one single leaf is found completely preserved. The ending -ites
can advantageously be added to modern families or genera to indicate a close resemblance. In
Sabal‘z‘tea as here used, a resemblance to the subfamily Sabaleae is implied.

The present species is represented by a large number of fragmentary specimens, of which the
figured specimen is the only one showing the basal portion 01 1110 blade. This cannot be dis-
tinguished from the type 01 figured specimen 01 what Knowlton called Sabczl montana from the
Vermejo formation. In this species Knowlton justifiably included the specimens from the Mon-
tana group (Me-saverde formation) 01 Point of Rocks, Wyoming, which Lesquereux had desig-
nated as Sabalz‘tes yrayanus. I am including also the specimen from the Denver formation which
Knowlton referred to §abolitos yraycmuS. This is different in many respects from the type 01
S. qrayanus (= Sahal yrayana) from the Eocene 01 Mississippi,l but cannot be separated from
Sabalites montana.

This species is also recorded from the Laramie formation, as indicated in the above synonymy.
The specimen from the Fruitland formation which Knowlton questionably referred to this species ²
is definitely of an entirely different type.
