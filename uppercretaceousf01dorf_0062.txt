50 CONTRIBUTIONS TO PALAEONTOLOGY

inclined to separate these into two species, M μνέαι torreyz' and M. obloozngrolia, on the basis of dif-
ferences in shape, the former with narrowly lanceolate leaves and the latter with long-elliptic to
ovate-lanceolate leaves. I am now convinced, however, from gradations in shape which are
apparent in the Medicine Bow collections and in various Upper Cretaceous collections at the U. S.
National Museum, that all of these specimens belong to a single species whose leaf characters are
amazingly consistent even though somewhat variable in size and shape. In view of the large
amount of new material collected, it seems desirable to re-describe the species here.

Descrvzssption (Supplementa7·y)—Leaves linear to narrowly lanceolate to long-elliptic, sym-
metrical, narrowed gradually to a long-cuneate base and a narrowly acute tip; length variable
from 5 to 15 cm., width from 1 to 5 cm.; average dimensions appear to be about 11 ern. by 2.5;
greatest width at the middle of the leaf or slightly below, petiole relatively short, thick, averaging
about 2 cm. in length; midrib prominent on the lower surface of the leaf ; secondaries usually
ineonspicuous, numerous, and closely spaced, leaving the midrib at obtuse angles varying from 50Ο
to 800, averaging about 700; secondaries irregularly forked, unbroken, or irregularly joined toward
the margin where they meet a prominent intramarginal vein which borders the entire leaf 1 to 2
mm. from the edge; indistinct veins join the intramarginal vein to the closely spaced marginal
serrations, which may be obscured by slight curling of the leaf margin ; tertiary venation obscure;
texture coriaceous.

M yrica torreyi, as previously conceived by various authors, is widely distributed in the late
Cretaceous sediments of the Rocky Mountain region. It has previously been recorded, usually
abundantly, in the Black Buttes, Lance, Laramie, Mesaverde, Fruitland, Fox Hills, and Vermejo
floras. Its presence in the Denver and Dawson floras is indicated by the specimens called M yrica
sp. and M. torreyz' minor which are clearly variants of the normal leaf type. Likewise, Myrica
coriacea from the Vermejo formation and M. dubia and M. oblonqzjfolia from the Laramie, which
were described as closely similar to M. torrem, are obviously only variants, a view which seems
the more likely because of the previous record of the normal M. torreyz' from these same beds.

This species is an important and diagnostic index species os the late Cretaceous. It has
never, to my knowledge, been reported from beds of undisputed Paleocene or younger age. Its
characteristics, moreover, are usually well defined and not likely to cause confusion with other types.

The reference of this fossil species to the genus M yrz'ca is open to question. I have consulted
all available herbarium sheets of both eastern and western hemisphere species of M yrica at The
New York Botanical Garden, and have failed to find any species whose leaves are comparable to
the fossil specimens. The pronounced intramarginal vein observed in the fossil species is never
present in the leaves of M yricffi neither are the fine teeth nor the closely set secondary veins.
The leaves of several genera of the Myrtaceae, on the other hand, are compa-rabie in most respects,
differing only, in some cases, in the absence of fine marginal serrations. In the genera Amomis,
Colycolpus, calypti-anthes, Euyefnia, and J ambosa, for example, most of the species possess leaves
of the same general shape and almost identical venation as in the fossil specimens. The closest
resemblance observed is with Eusqenz'a jambolczna Lam. (sheet No. 5601) and E. (Phyllocalyx) sp.
(sheet No. 7559) of Brazil, and with J ambosa jambos (L.) Millsp. (sheet No. 15020) of Colombia;
these differ from the sossii leaves only in the absence of marginal serrations. It seems likely that
M yrica torreyz' will ultimately be referred to M yrtophyllum Heer, indicating resemblance to the
family Myrtaceae.
