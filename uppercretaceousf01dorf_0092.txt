Carpites walcotti Dorf, n. sp.
(Plate 19, Figs. 1, 2)

There are 6 nearly perfect specimens from 3 localities which are obviously elongate seeds.
Comparable fossil seeds are apparently rare. They bear a superficial resemblance to the seeds
referred to Pz‘sonia fructifera Berry from the Wilcox flora ¹ but are clearly not the same species.

Description—-Seeds narrowly elliptic in flattened view, abruptly truncate at the apex and
gradually narrowed below to an acutely cuneate base; length rather consistently 1.5 cm„ width 4
to 5 mm., peduncle stout, long, up to 1.8 cm„ surface ribbed, the costae widely spaced and num-
bering 3 or 4; apex invested with thiu, short projections, the o'uter ones longer than the inner ones.

These seeds are unusually complete and should be easily identified generically. Ι have as
yet found no modern seeds, however, which 1 could consider strictly comparable. Those of
Nyssa aquatica Linne‚ which are borne singly on long peduncles, are often of precisely the same
character,2 though they may become larger and more rounded.

occurrence—North of Walcott, Wyoming, Loc. P. 373; Elk Mountain road, VVyoming, Loc.
P. 374; Craig, Colorado, Loc. P. 375.

Seeds (‘?) of this type are rather abundant in the collections, being represented by more than
a (lozen specimens. They are essentially like the type and figured specimens of this species, which
is common in the Black Buttes flora. No other fossil occurrences are known. The exact nature
of these speciinens has not been determined.

Phyllites trillioides Dorf, n. sp.
(Plate 17, Fig. 3)

There are but 2 incomplete specimens of this type in the collections. The general outline,
venation, and heart-shaped base are typical of the leaves usually referred to Smilax. In modern
leaves of Smilax, however, 1 have never seen forking primary veins such as are present in these
fossil specimens. The leaves of Tr'z'llz'una on the other hand, are almost always characterized by
forking primaries (cf. T. cernuum Linne).³ In the absence of more complete material, however,
it 15 impossible to make a definite generic reference.

These specimens resemble both smilax? inquirenda Knowlton from the Laramie formation 4
and S. carbonensis Cockercll from the Hanna formation.⁵ There are enough characters preserved,
however, to indicate that they are not conspecific with either.

Occurrence—Craig, Colorado‚ Loc. P. 375.

Bra-:ts (?)
(Plate 14, Fig. 2)

There are several well-defined specimens which may be seed bracts or bud scales. Although
their systematic position is problematical, they are sufficiently well preserved to be recorded for
possible future reference.
