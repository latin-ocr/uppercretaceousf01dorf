FOX HILLS AND LOWER MEDICINE BOW 27

In the interpretation and application of the data presented in table ⁶2, it is
evident in the first place that on the basis of margin clurraeters the Medicine Bow
association is eomparable to forests approaching the subtropieal in aspect. Thc
large number of entire-leaved species (6792) is only 45} less than ssailey and Sin-
nott’s lowest figure sor subtropical forests. Among fossil floras the Medicine Bow
assemblage is of decidedly warnier aspect than the floras of the Bridge (freek (15522),
the Green River (2991), and thc Florissant (3⁴3th the Wilcox flora, on the other
hand, appears to be more subtropical (8392). The Goshen and Laramic floras are
more nearly similar to the Medicine Bow in percontage of entire-leaved species.
The Goshen flora (6152), according to Chaney and Sanborn,l indicates a humid,
subtropical climate. The Laramic flora (7170) has unfortunately not as yet been
thoroughly studied with a view to accurate postulation of climatis: conditions.

In the column under “ Length’' in table 2, the percentage of large leaves in the
hffedicine Bow flora shows likewise its closest relationship to that of the Goshen
flora. In nervation characters a closer similarity is shown to the Weaverville
flora, which MacGinitie2 has described as a warm temperate association‚ com-
parable to the modern flora of southern Alabama. Although the remaining leaf
characters are not regarded as sufficiently trustworthy criteria for individual con-
sideration, they tend to substantiatc the similarity of the Medicine Bow species
to those of the subtropical Goshen flora on the one hand and the warm temperate
Weavervillc flora on the other.

To summarize the inferences made on the basis of reliably tested leaf charac-
ters, it is evident that the Medicine Bow flora is distinctly not a cool temperate
assemblage² but is intermediate in character between warm temperate and sub-
tropicaL more nearly approaching the latter.

PAST CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AS INDICATED BY THE FLORA

In addition to climatic studies based upon leaf characters, environmental con-
ditions of the past may also be estimated by comparing the fossil species of a given
flora with their nearest living relatives; it may be inferred that the past conditions
were analogous to those under which the majority of living relatives grow.

The application of this method to the lower Medicine Bow flora encounters
several difficulties. In the first place, many of the fossi] species are not generically
comparable to any living forms which have come to my attention. This may
mean one of at least three things: (1) these genera may not have survived from
the Upper Cretaceous to the present; (2) they may be ancestral types from which
descendants with somewhat different leaf characters have since evolved; or (3) they
may belong to genera with Which I am unfamiliar. In the second place, even when
identifications are more certain, it cannot be established that in the Upper Creta-
ceous a genus responded to climatic influences precisely as it does today. This
difficulty is in a large measure overcome by placing less stress upon individual
genera in the fossil flora and more upon the flora as a whole. Thirdly, where close
