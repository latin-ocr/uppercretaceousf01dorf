relationships 'nave been established between fossil forms and living genera and
speciesy it is often difficult to determine from either literature or herbarium speci-
mens the precise distribution and climatic requirements of the living relatives.
This applies particularly to subtropical and tropical forms.

To anyone familiar with temperate forests of either hemisphere, it is apparent
that the lower Medicine Bow flora is distinctly not a cool temperate assemblage.
The absence of typically cool temperate genera is striking. Rather than rely on
such negative evidence, I would emphasize that the majority of the lower Medicine
Bow species which are comparable to living forms show close resemblances to
genera now living in warm temperate and subtropical forests, as shown in table 3.
Fossil species which have not been found comparable to any modern leaves have
been omitted from this list.

The distribution of modern correlatives and alternatives shown in table 3
indicates that only a small number of genera are found in cool temperate assem-
blages. With no exceptions, moreover, these few genera are of non-restricted
distribution, extending in all cases into warm temperate or subtropical associations.
Some of them, such as N yssa, M aqualia, Drimys, and Viburnum are in fact more
numerous and widespread in warmer forests, and extend into the cool temperate
regions only in a limited number or a limited area. The large number of generic
correlatives of warm temperate and subtropical forests clearly substantiates the
inferences based upon the characters of leaves of the Medicine Bow species. The
relatively large number of tropical genera represented does not imply close relation-
ship to lowland tropical forests, since none of these genera is restricted to such
habitatsÍ¾ all of them are equally well developed in subtropical associations, and
may range into the warni temperate.

A consideration of several individual families whose presence is well estab-
lished in the Medicine Bow flora adds weight to the climatic inferences based upon
leaf characters and the aspect of the flora as a whole. Most convincing, perhaps,
is the family Palmae, represented by Sabalites eccem'ca and S. montana. Although
the actual genus to which these species belong may be in doubt, their reference to
the palm family cannot be questioned. In the living flora, palms are typically
tropical and subtropical in distribution. Their most northerly representatives
range only into the warm temperate lowlands of the Atlantic Coast <Sahal palmetto
and Serenoa serrulam), California (Washinytonia filamcntosa), southern Europe
(Chamoerops humilis), and southern Asia (Chamoerops spp. and Rhfapis spp.).
The Pandanaceae, represented by the fossil species Pandamtes corsomf, the Myrta-
ceae (M yrica torreyz'), the Dilleniaceae (Rhamnus cleburni), and the Lauraceae
(Laurophyllum mceki, F icus iamlam, Rhamnus salicifolz'us) are likewise typically
tropical and subtropical families whose modern distribution in temperate forests is
restricted to the warm lowlands bordering the subtropics.

The combined evidence presented from the study of the leaf characters of the
Medicine Bow species, the distribution of closely related genera of the flora as a
whole, and the climatic requirements of modern families which are represented in
the fossil flora is consistent throughout in indicating Warm temperate to subtropical
