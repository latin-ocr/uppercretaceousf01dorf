This type 01 leaf is recorded from 5 01 the 6 Medicine Bow localities and is usually one of the
dominants. The large number of specimens collected for study were at first considered to repre-
sent 5 distinct species on the basis of identity vm'th figured specimens. It was confusing, however,
to discover that there were intermediate types present with a few characteristics 01 000 5000105
but the remaining characteristics of another species. After consulting the type collections at the
U. S. National Museum, it has seemed necessary to regard all of these species as variants 01 a
single rather well-defined leaf type.

The original specimen 01 Dryophyllum (Quercus) subsalcatum was collected from what is now
called the Mesaverde formation at Point of Rocks, Wyoming. In the following decade Ward
and Newberry independently described additional specimens of this same type of leaf from the
same locality, as Dryophyllum bruueri Ward and Quercus gracilis Newberry. Neither author
mentioned the work of the other nor made any reference to the similar leaf described by Lesque-
reux. Knowlton clarified this situation by synonymizing both species with Dryophynum sub-
salcatum,¹ although D. bruneri was inadvertently restored to its specific status in Bulletin 696.

From the. slightly younger Black Buttes flora of the same region specimens of essentially
identical type were variously described as D. aquamarum Ward, Quercus doljensis Pilar, and Rhus
pseudo-memma Lesquereux. In a recent synonymy Brown has included the first of these in
Dryophyllum subsalcatum.2 Ι am including the last two, already combined as one species by
Knowlton,³ as possessing no recognizable differences. Brown has also included, on justifiable
evidence, the specimens hitherto referred to Dryophyllum falcatum Ward, Quercus whitmani
Knowlton, and Q. turbulenta Hollick from scattered beds of late Cretaceous age. To these I
would add the specimen of Fraxinus? princetomssana from the Laramie flora.

Among my specimens which 1 have collected from the lower Lance east 01 Lance Greek,
Wyoming, there are several specimens of Dryoplzyzzmn subsalcatum to add to the Lance occurrences
recorded by Knowlton ⁴ and Brown.⁵ Moreover, a single specimen of the same species was tenta-
tively described as Juylans? confusa by Knowlton in an unfinished manuscript on a collection
from the Lance formation 01 “Converse County,” Wyoming.

As now conceived by Dr. Brown and me, this is a valuable index species 01 1110 late Creta-
ceous, being well defined, widespread, and usually abundant. It is unfortunate that as good use
cannot be made 01 itin ecologic and climatic considerations owing to its uncertain botanical affinities.
Cretaceous leaves of this type are usually referred without further consideration to the genus
Dryophyllum, held to be prototypic 01 the family Fagaceae. Tertiary specimens of the same
general character are ordinarily referred to Castanea or Quercus, though 01100 on insufficient evi-
dence. Ι would hesitate, in the absence of seeds, to remove the present species to either Castanea
or Quercus, although the resemblance to many species of these genera 15 admittedly striking.
