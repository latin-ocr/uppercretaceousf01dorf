Cinnamomum affine Lesquereux

The nearly complete leaf (figure 3) is the best of about a dozen of this type in the collections.
It is not wholly typical. It has the tri-nerved venation diverging from a point along the midrib well
above the petiole, which is so typical of cinnamomum affine, yet it differs slightly in shape, which
is wider and less pointed than the average of our specimens (figure 4), and in the presence of an
indistinct pair of veins below the lateral primaries. These veins are not usually present in the
recorded leaves of this species, though occasionally seen, as in Lesquereux's figure 7. Judging
from the specimens in the Medicine Bow collections, these veins are more common than has
hitherto been observed. It may be that this character is important enough to distinguish these
leaves as a separate species. For the present I consider them conspecific.

This species is known at present only from the Laramie, Colgate, and Medieine Bow forma-
tions. It may possibly 3150 occur in the Denver formation in what has been referred to cinnamo-
mum sp„ sor want of complete specimens.¹ A larger suite of Laramie specimens might also indicate
that C. laramz'ensis Knowlton ² is but a narrow variant of the normal C. affine type.

A resemblance of these fossil specimens to the leaves of the modern cinnamomum cannot
be denied. The subsidiary basal veins and the faintness of the tertiary venation, however, are
features not observed in cinnamomum.

There are 2 specimens which are indistinguishable from those previously referred to the' above
two species of Lesquereux and Ward. Their specimens were both collected from the same
locality, Black Buttes, Wyoming, and are clearly the same species. The specimen here figured
from the Medicine Bow formation looks, indeed, like a counterpart to the specimen figured by
Ward, which is clearly not, as he himself intimates, referable to Watelet’s European species. The
generic reference to Laurophyllum is purposely non-committal, though indicating resemblance to
lauraceous leaves. It is unfortunate that in all known specimens of this species the base and
apex are both destroyed, making a complete description impossible.

Description—Leaves lanceolate to elliptic, narrowed gradually to the base and apex, whose
specific characters are not known; length apparently about 12 to 15 cm.; width 4 to 5 cm. at the
widest portion just below the middle; midrib fairly thick, straight ; secondaries prominent, 6 to 8
subopposite pairs, branching acutely from the midrib at angles of 25⁰ to 300, curving slightly
upward, converging gradually upon the leaf margins in a long series of prominent, quadrate loops;
basal secondaries with prominent looping tertiaries on their lower side; remaining tertiary veins
prominent, regular, and coarse, running at angles close to 90ο to the midrib; margin entire, slightly
undulate; texture subcoriaceous.

There do not appear to be any other described fossil forms of this genus, or related genera,
with which this species can be compared.

I have named the species for Professor F. B. Meek, who collected the first specimen of this
type at Black Buttes, Wyoming.

Occurrence—Elk Mountain road, Wyoming, Loc. P. 374; Craig, Colorado, Loc. P. 376.

collection—U. C. Mus. Pal., Plesiotype No. 1334.
