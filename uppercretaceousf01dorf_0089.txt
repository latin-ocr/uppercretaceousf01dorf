distinct.’' ¹ Knowlton followed Hcer in referring the specics to I’latanzts, but in inore recent re-
ports both Berry ² and Brown ³ have reverted to the original reference to Vilmrnnm, in which I
concur. In comparisons with modern herbarium material at The New York Botanical Ganlen, Ι
have seen no leaves of Pantanus comparable to the combination of characters obscrvcd in thc
leaves of Viburnum marqunammL. These bear a close resemblance to several specics of Vllum-12 um,
however, such as the specics mentioned by Lesquereux, and more particularly V. opalus and
V. pauczflorum of North America and V. surgentia· Koehn of China.

The collections contain only 4 well-preserved specimcns of this form, of which the best is
here figured. This is difficult to distinguish from the type and figured specimens of the two species
mentioned above, particularly those from the V ermejo formation.

It is possible, as Knowlton has pointed out, that these specimens are variants of Viburnum
marqitmlum Lesquereux. In the absence of gradational variants between the narrow elliptic
leaves of V. montanum and the typieal smaller leaves of V. maminotum shown on plate 15, figure
3, it seems necessary to maintain the former as distinct. I suspect that a larger suite of speei-
mens os this speeies might bring out a close resemblance and possibly identity to the leaves
referred to V. corztortmn,⁴ which is known from the Raton and Black Buttes floras, and to V.

speciosum from the Raton.5
The previously recorded oecurrences of V. montanum are limited to the Mesaverde and

Vermejo formatioris of Colorado and to the undifferentiated Montana group of Utah.
I ean suggest no better generic reference for this species than Viburmcm.

DICOTYLEDONAE—POSITION UNCERTAIN

Phyllites craigensis Dorf, n. sp.
(Plate 18, Fig. 3)

There are 4 well-preserved specimens of a very distinctive type of leaf from Loeality P. 375.
Ι have been unable to find any fossil or living species with which a comparison could be made.
It seems desirable, nevertheless, to describe and figure the species for future reference.

Description—Leaves wide-elliptic, with the base broadly cuneate and the tip acutely rounded;
length ranging from 8 to 13 cm.‚ width from 4 to 8 cm„ widest at the middle; petiole very stout,
short, wider than the midrib; midrib very thick below, gradually thinning toward the apex;
se'oondary venation indistinct‚ pinnate, 12 to 18 pairs of secondaries mainly decurrent along the
midrib, diverging at an angle of about 400 near the base and a somewhat greater angle near the
apex; secondaries branched irregularly and acutely, curving only slightly upward, becoming
indistinct near the margins; tertiary venation obsolete; margin entire, texture coriaceous.

In both shape and venation the fossil specimens approximate the leaves of several living
speeies of the genera Drz'mys and Illz'cium of the Magnoliaeeae. The resemblance to Illicium
floridanum Ellis is striking in all characters except width and expanded petiole.
