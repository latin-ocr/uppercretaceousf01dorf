72 CONTRIBUTIONS To PALAEONTOLOGY

Lesquereux, Ward, and Knowlton. Ι am following the practice of Newberry and Berry in applying
the less positive name Cornophyllum to the specimens. In addition to a resemblance to leaves of
Cornua the fossil leaves are also comparable in general form and venation to Rhavmidium (Rham-
naceae), Berchemia (Rhamnaceae) and Premna (Verbenaceae).

There are four nearly complete specimens in the collections which resemble one or another
of the somewhat variable leaves previously referred to this species. Of the specimens here
shown, figure 1 resembles more closely the numerous specimens from the Laramie formation,
including Lesquereux’s type specimen shown in volume 7, plate 47, figure 5. The other Medicine
Bow specimen, figure 2, is more of the type of Lesquereux's figure 4, and is clearly the same
species as the Vermej0 specimens referred to Phyllites populoides and Populus? neomezzffcana.
Knowlton's discussions os Dombeyopsis obtusa in the reports cited above have adequately treated
its taxonomic relationships and its variability. It may be added here that the apex of the leaf
may be slightly emarginate, as shown in both my specimens.

This species is now known from the Laramie, Trinidad‚ Vermej0, lower Denver, Dawson,
and lower Medicine Bow formatioris, and is not known from beds of indisputable Paleocene or
later age.

I have found no modern leaves closely resembling those of this species. Analogous types are
met with in the genera Ficus (Moraceae) and Cocculus (Menispermaceae)‚ but these are not
sufficiently similar for exact comparison.

Dombeyopsis trivialis Lesquereux

Dombeyopsz's trivialis Lesquereux, U. S. Geol. SurV. Tern, 6th Ann. Rept. (1872), 380, 1873; Rept. U. S. Geol.
{in-{4 ngrr} νΐὲὲζ, 255, pl. 47, fig. 3, 187& Knowlton, U. S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Paper 130, 163, pl. 13, fig. 3,

From 31 specimens encountered in the field, 9 well-preserved specimens of this type of leaf
were collected for study. The average leaf form, shown here in figures 1 and 4, plate 16, re-
sembles closely the tri-lobed figured specimen of Dombeyopsz‘s trivialis, which Lesquereux obtained
from the Laramie formation. The resemblance to the actual type specimen at the U. S. National
Museum is even closer. The drawing of this specimen is not strictly correct. Actually, the central
and lateral lobes are more obtuse and rounded, essentially as in the Medicine Bow specimens.

The specimen shown here in figure 4, plate 15, was at first considered quite distinct. For-
tunately, the features of the leaf shown in figure 2 seem to be intermediate in character between
this smaller, more elongate leaf and the larger, more rounded leaf of figures 1 and 4. There seems
also to be a gradational increase in the size of the lateral lobes, and a widening of the base from the
smaller leaf form to the larger. Recognizing the typcs of variations to be expected in a lobed
leaf form of this pattern, it seems justifiable to regard the three specimens as conspecific. In
view of the variability shown it is desirable to amplis y the original description of this species, which
was based on a single fragmentary specimen.
