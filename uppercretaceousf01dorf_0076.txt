Genus MAGNOLIOPHYLLUM Conwentz
Magnoliophyllum cordatum Dorf, n. sp.
(Plate 9, Fig. 5; Plate 10, Fig. 1)

This type of leaf is fairly abundant, although its large size has made it impossible to procure
complete specimens. The figured specimen is the most nearly complete of over 80 specimens
collected in the field.

Descriptz'0n.——Leaves cordate to broadly ovate, symmetrical, with the base cordate to trun-
cate and the tip acute; length ranging from 10 to 18 cm., width from 8 to 16 cm., petiole stout and
up to 2.5 cm. long; midrib very stout ; secondaries well defined, ten to twelve pairs mostly alternate,
leaving the midrib at angles varying from slightly more than 90Ο near the base, to 600 at the middle,
and to 50Ο or less near the tip; hasal secondaries only slightly arched upward, upper secondaries
arching upward more abruptly, producing a greater distance between the secondaries near the
margins than at the midrib; one to three prominent tertiaries branching from lower sides of
secondaries forming conspicuous loops with superjacent tertiaries or secondaries close to the
margins, remaining tertiaries strong, percurrent, forming a coarse network in the intersecondary
spaces; margin mainly entire, occasionally undulate in the upper half of large leaves, texture firm.

It seems strange that this well-defined type of leaf has apparently not been encountered
previously in the late Cretaceous deposits of North America. I believe, however, that it is closely
related to the specimens from the Raton formation which Knowlton referred to M aqnozz'a cordisolia
Lesquereux.¹ There are notable differences, however, chiefly in the character of the base, the
upper secondaries, and the number and prominence of the marginal loops, all of which are con-
sistently the same in M aqnoliophyllum cordatum.

I have not been able to determine the taxonomic affinities of this species, although its char-
acters are strongly suggestive of the family Magnoliaceae. The smaller leaves of the living
M aynolia dealbata Zucc. of Mexico and the larger leaves of M. acuminata Linne of southeastern
United States ² are of the same size and have almost identical venation and basal characters. I
have found no other modern leaves which are so nearly identical, so do not hesitate in referring
the species to M aqnoliophyllum, implying relationship to the family Magnoliaceae.

This type of seed is represented in the collections by a compound raceme and its counterpart
and several detached fruits.

Berry described specimens from the Wilcox formation as the variety minor of the well-known
and widespread chmninosz'tes? arachioides (Lesqucreux) Lesquereux, on the basis of their smaller
size. The Medicine Bow specimens appear to be slightly smaller still, though of the same size
exactly as several detached fruits from the Wilcox and Denver. In every other respect our speci-
mens are identical with the type and figured specimens from the Wilcox, the Raton, and the Denver
formatioris. The species is also recorded from the Animas, Dawson, and Black Buttes floras.
