lenticularis, were shown to come from strata included within the basal part of the
Medicine Bow formation and not from the sandstones within the upper part of the
Lewis shale. The writer’s field studies and collectionS, which are later described in
detail, are in agreement with these observations. It is clearly evident, therefore,
that sediments of Fox Hills age form a part of what has hitherto been regarded as
the basal portion of the Medicine Bow formation. The recognition of the Fox Hills
formation in the region must then depend on whether or not it can be distinguished
as a separable lithologic unit. The following criteria for the recognition and de-
limitation of this formation in northeastern Colorado have recently been published
by a committee of the Rocky Mountain Association of Petroleum Geologists ¹
after a field conference with Dr. J. B. Reeside‚ Jr.:

“The base of the Fox Hills formation shall be considered as the horizon below which the
section is predominantly gray marine clay shales and sandy shales of Pierre age, and above which
the section changes rapidly to a buff to brown sandstone containing numerous large gray to brown,
hard, sandy concretions. This lower concretionary member is commonly overlain by a series of
light gray to brown sandstones and sandy shales.

“The top of the Fox Hills formation shall be considered as the horizon above which the
section is composed predominantly of fresh and brackish-water deposits accompanied by coals
and lignitic shales, and below which it is predominantly marine.''

The application of these criteria to the basal 400ss feet of the Medicine Bow
formation has recently been made by Conway in an unpublished report.² He has
pointed out that all of the above requirements are exactly fulfilled in the sections
which he studied near Corson Ranch, near Walcott, and near Rawlins in this area.
It is interesting to note that the lowest coal beds in the sections are invariably at
the horizon which separatos the underlying marine saunas from the overlying fresh
and brackish-water saunas, and which also separates the massive, more persistent
sandstones below from the thinner, lenticular sandstones above. For practical
purposes of mapping, therefore, the lowest coal beds can be regarded as the base
of the Medicine Bow formation.

The horizons which have yielded plant remains all lie within the basal 1300 feet
of the Medicine Bow formation, as here redefined. Each horizon has been ac-
curately located with reference to the characteristic Fox Hills fauna, of which the
ammonite Sphenodiscus lenticularis is regarded as the most trustworthy and
diagnostic index species. It is certain, therefore, that the evidence from strati-
graphic position and from marine invertebrates indicates post-Fox Hills age for
the plant-bearing horizons. Their pre-Fort Union age is equally clearly indicated
by the presence of ceratopsian dinosaurs and invertebrates of Lance age in the
Medicine Bow formation, and Triceratops dinosaurs in the basal beds of the over-
lying Ferris formation.³ The combined geologic data, exclusive of the plant evi-
dence, are, therefore, consistent throughout in supporting a reference of the Medicine
Bow formation as of Lance age, or more specifically as of Hell Creek age. The
