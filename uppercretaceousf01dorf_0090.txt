Phyllites wilderi Dorf, n. sp.
(Plate 18, Fig. 4)

The single specimen figured is the only one of this kind in the collections. I have been unable
to find any figured fossil forms with which a comparison was justified. The specimen is complete
enough, however, to warrant description and figure for possible future reference.

Descrz'ption—Leaf oval-obovate‚ with asymmetrical, acutely cuneate base, and short, bluntly
pointed tip; length approximately 11 cm., width about 4.5 cm. at the widest portion just above
the middle ; midrib heavy, straight; about 8 pairs of thin secondariesy mainly opposite or subop-
posite, rather equally and distantly spaced, branching from the midrib at an angle of 500 to 600,
and converging slightly toward the margin where they form inconspicuous loops with the second-
aries above ; margin entire ; texture firm.

The species is named for Mr. Beverly Wilder, who assisted in the collection of the material.

Definite generic allocation of this specimen cannot be made until a larger suite of better
material can be obtained.

Phyllites conwayi Dorf, n. sp.
(Plate 18, Fig. 2)

The figured specimen is the only one of this type of leaf in the collections. It is so nearly
complete, however, that it seems desirable to record its presence in the Medicine Bow flora. No
comparable fossil forms have been recorded, to my knowledge.

Description—-Leaf obovate, narrowed rather abruptly to a slightly acuminate, rounded tip
and more gradually to an apparently broadly cuneate base, length about 11 cm., width 7.5 cm.;
midrib stout and straight; 6 to 7 pairs of prominent secondaries, occasionally decurrent, leaving
the midrib at angles of 400 to 600, arching abruptly upward well within the margin to join sec-
ondaries above or their lower branches in wide loops; tertiary veins fairly prominent, widely
spaced, mainly percurrent, occasionally parallel to secondaries along the midrib; margin entire;
texture fairly thin.

I have no suggestions regarding a generic reference for this specimen.

Phyllites colubrinoides Dors, n. sp.
(Plate 19, Figs. 4, 5)

There are 8 specimens from 2 localities which at first seem comparable to the leaves referred
to Trochodendroides nebrascensz's. Closer scrutiny, however, reveals a number of differences which
are so constant that 1 am convinced that these leaves belong to a different species, if not also a
different genus. The main points of distinction appear to be the thick coriaceous texture, the
relatively large, evenly spaced teeth, the turned-down petiole, the narrowly cuneate base and the
inward-looping prominent secondaries and tertiaries in the leaves here referred to Plzyll‘z‘tes colu-
brinoides.

Description—-Leaves wide-lanceolate to elliptic‚ gradually narrowed to an acute apex and a
narrowly cuneate base; length 3 to 6.5 cm., width 2 to 3.3 cm.; petiole turned abruptly downward,
not well preserved3 prominently 3 pli-nerved from the top of the petiole, the midrib and lateral
primaries of almost equal strength 3 lateral primaries leaving the midrib at 300 angle or less, curving
abruptly upward, paralleling midrib to near the apex where they fork into two veins, one of which
enters a marginal tooth, the other looping inward to join the upper secondaries; one pair of prom-
inent secondaries diverging acutely from above the middle of the midrib, running subparallel to
the midrib, forking into the marginal teeth, and ultimately looping inward to join the midrib near
the apex; 5 or 6 prominent secondaries given off from the marginal side of the lateral primaries,
looping distinctly upward to join the ones above, and giving off less prominent tertiary veins into
