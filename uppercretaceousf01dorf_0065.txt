The long synonymy cited above illustrates clearly the prevalence of this type of leaf in the
Lance, Laramie, Black Buttes, Dawson, and Denver floras. The large number of “species'’ from
the Denver flora which are here combined with Quercus viburnisolia might be open to criticism.
After studying the type specimens at the U. S. National Museum Ι find it impossible, however, to
segregate them into distinct species with truly recognizable differences. The alternatives were
either to merge them into a single species, whose leaves are somewhat variable—though no more
so than those of a single modern tree; or to separate the specimens into about 10 species based on
minor differences in shape, venation, or marginal characters. To avoid rather than produce con-
fusion, it was thought best to combine the specimens, incidentally adding greater value to the
species for correlat-ion purposes.

Specimens of this species were collected from 5 of the Medicine Bow localities. In none of
these is the species as abundantly represented as it is in the collections from the Denver formation.
Its presence in both the Laramie and Lance formatioris is reported in Professional Paper 130 cited
above, as well as in an unpublished manuscript of Knowlton's seen at the U. S. National Museum.
It is apparent that this species is not present in any of the extensive Fort Union or Eocene col-
lections at the Museum, nor has it ever been reported in beds either older or younger than post-
Montana Cretaceous.

The generic reference of this species to Quercus seems open to question. I have consulted
herbarium material of all genera of the Fagaceae and have not succeeded in finding any leaves of
comparable form. The general shape, venation, and character of marginal teeth of the fossil
leaves seem rather to relate them to the Betulaceae or the Caprifoliaceae.
