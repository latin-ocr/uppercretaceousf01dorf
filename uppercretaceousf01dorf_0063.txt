Fox HILLs AND LOWER MEDICINE Bow 51

Black Buttes floras. They are similarly indistinguishablc from the original types consulted at
the U. S. National Museum. These were apparently misplaced at the time Knowlton wrote
Professional Paper 130, but have since been located.

Both Lesquereux and Knowlton have considered the possibility that these leaves might
represent variants of Juqlans ruyosa Lesquereux or J. rhasmrmzssdes Lesquereux. The continued
discovery of leaves of the J. leconceana type, and the absence of leaves of the former types in the
same strata tend to corroborate the maintenanee of the latter species as distinct. The reference
to the genus Juqlans seems to be based on insufficient evidence.

I have noted a close resemblance of the specimens to the leaves of Μ achara (B'Ioraceze),
especially M. aurantiaca Nutt., and Apocynum (Apocynaeeae), especially A. pubescens (?). Until
some positive grounds are established for a change in name it seems best, however, to retain the
old one.

Occurrence—North of VValcott, Wyoming, Loc. P. 373; Elk Mountain road, Wyoming, Loc.

Juglans newberryi Knowlton
(Plate 4, Fig. 4)
J uylans newberryi Knowlton, U. S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Paper 130, 120, pl. 20, figs. 8-10, 1922.

The single specimen figured is the only one of this type in the collections. It is identical with
the specimens of this species from the Laramie formation. Although Knowlton described the
margins of his specimens as entire, the type specimens at the U. S. National Museum are some-
what obscure along the margins, like the specimen here discussed, and appear to have a few fine
serrations in the upper half of the leaf.

These leaves resemble somewhat those of J uylans crossia· Knowlton from the Green River
formation,¹ differing mainly in the marginal characters and the more closely spaced secondary
veins. The reference to J uqlans may be correct, although several species of Sapindus have leaves
which are virtually identical.

Juglans praerugosa Knowlton
(Plate 4, Fig. 6)
Juylans proeruqosa Knowlton, U. S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Paper 130, 121, pl. 5, fig. 2, pl. 21, fig. 5, 1922.

This type of leaf is represented only by the complete specimen figured and several fragments.
I was at first inclined to refer these to J uylans denverz‘ana Knowlton ² or J. rugosa Lesquereux ³ but
find what seem to be important differences in shape, margin, and venation. In these characters
the specimen is indistinguishable from the type and figured specimens of J. praeruqosa from the
Laramie, and fits its description perfectly. Knowlton has already reported the occurrence of
this species in the Medicine Bow formation of the same region from which my collections were
made.⁴ I have not been able to match these specimens with any modern leaves.

Occurrence—YCorson Ranch, Wyoming‚ Loc. P. 3713 Craig, Colorado‚ Loc. P. 376.
