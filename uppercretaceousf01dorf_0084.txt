the Judith River (2²), Fox Hills, Colgate, Lance, and Medicine Bow floras. It is apparently most
abundant in the lower Lance formation, from which Ι have collected a considerable number of
perfect specimens near Lance Creek, Wyoming, and near Buffalo, South Dakota.

The reference to the genus Vitis seems reasonable though as yet not corroborated by asso-
ciated seeds, flowers, or wood.

There are 2 well-preserved, incomplete specimens from Locality P. 374 which are similar
except for their somewhat smaller size to the type and figured specimens of this species from the
Laramie formation. Its very truncate base, thick midrib, and thiu, closely spaced, widely diver-
gent secondaries are easily recognizable and diagnostic.

The generic reference has been Justifiably questioned by Knowlton. Until more complete
specimens are found, however, it is difficult to attempt a taxonomic revision.

This type of leaf is by far the most abundant at Locality P. 374. Over 25 well-preserved
specimens were collected for study. The majority of these cannot be distinguished in any
essential detail from the type specimens from Black Buttes, Wyoming. These were originally
described as Aleurites cocenim by Lesquereux, who subsequently changed the name to Grewz'opsis
saportana. In a later report Knowlton changed the name again to Grew‘iopsis cocenim, a procedure
which hardly seems justified, as has been pointed out by Brown. Knowlton also included Ward’s
specimens of Grewz'ops'z's ficisolz'a in this species, a reference clearly substantiated by the numerous
Medicine Bow specimens. In view of the large number of variants now available it seems appro-
priate to re-describe the species.

Description (Supplementary)-Leaves elliptic-lanceolate to ovate, narrowing gradually to a
blunt, obtuse point and more abruptly to a symmetrical, cuneate base; length 4.5 to 9.5 cm.; width
2.2 to 6.5 cm.‚ widest below the middle ; average dimensions apparently about 7.5 by 4.5 cm.;
petiole relativcly thin, very long, up to 5 cm.; midrib heavy except near apex, fairly straight;
6 to 9 pairs of secondaries, mainly alternate, pinnate, approaching palmateness in basal pair,
leaving midrib at angles of about 300 near apex to as high as 600 near base; venation craspeclodrome,
the secondaries irregularly curved toward the margins where they usually branch into the mar-
ginal teeth, these branches being more numerous in lower secondaries; tcrtiary venation distinct,
uniform, the veins continuous or branched at angles approaching 90Ο to the seeondaries3 margin
finely serrate or denticulate, often inconspicuously; the teeth short, irregular in size, and usually
closely spaced; texture subcoriaceous.
