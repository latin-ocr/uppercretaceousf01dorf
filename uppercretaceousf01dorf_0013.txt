STRATIGRAPHY AND PALAEONTOLOGY OF THE FOX HILLS AND
LOWER MEDICINE BOW FORMATION OF SOUTHERN
WYOMING AND NORTHWESTERN COLORADO

INTRODUCTION

In view of the controversial nature of the Lanee and related floras in connection
with 3[esozoie-(*enozoic boundar)⁷ problems, it is rather 1115601166111119,Γ to sind that
neither the Lance nor the closely related Medicine Bow floras have ever been ade-
quately studied or described. It is the purpose 01 this paper to outline the stratig-
raphy and palaeontology of the Medieine Bow formation, and to describe and
diseuss the fossil plants collected from this formation during the past two years.
The 5111111ν 01 1116 Lance floras of Wyoming, Montana, and the Dakotas is in progress
and will form the basis of subsequent papers, While my interest is 11111113111)ν 111
1116 511666551011 01 Upper Cretaceous floras of the West and their relation to succeed-
ing Cenozoic floras, it is hoped that the results of these studies will help to harmonize
1116 conflicting lines 01 palaeontologic and stratigraphic evidence regarding the
Mesozoic—Cenozoic boundary in the Rocky Mountain region.

For many ¹vears, confusion has 3115611 110111 1116 practice of including all the coal-
bearing 1011113110115 01 1116 Upper C retaceous and lower Tertiary in the all-embracing
“Laramie Group'‘; as a result, few of the contained floras could be adopted as
standards for comparison in other fields As in all other branchos of stratigraphic
palaeontology, it is necessary first to establish a standard fauna or flora whose age
is definitely known from other lines of evidence. Thereafter, the age 01 011161 saunas
01 110135 6311 be determined by comparison and 601111351. The Medicine Bow flora
is admirably suited 10 serve as such a standard because its age 6311 be rather defi-
nitely determined by its relation to both invertebrate and vertebrate saunas 01 known
age.

The 5111611ν 01 1116 Medicine Bow flora is part 01 3 program on Upper Cretaceous
floras 01 1116 Rocky Mountain region which I have undertaken under the joint
auspices 01 1116 Carnegie Institution 01 Washington and Princeton University. The
distribution of the 6 1063111165 110111 which the 105511 plants were obtained 15 indicated
in figure 1. At each of these localities the sections were carefully measured by
compass-traverses, and the exact stratigraphic position 01 63611 plant-bearing
horizon was determined with reference to a well-established and diagnostic 13111131
zone 01 1116 underlying Fox Hills formation. Sections were measured by A. P.
Conway, Dean Η111, and M. L. Rittenhouse, students at Princeton University, who
also identified most 01 1116 invertebrates collected. The invertebrate identifications
were checked by Dr. John B. Reeside 01 1116 U. S. Geological Survey. Friendly
encouragement and constructive eriticism have been freely given by Dr. Ralph W.
Chaney of the University 01 California. Valuable suggestions in various phases 01
1116 study have been made by Dr. Roland W. Brown 01 1116 U. S. Geological Survey,

and Dr. S. H. Knight 01 1116 Univcrsity of lVyoming. Herbarium material has been
