piensis and Ficus plinerva Chaney and Sanborn¹ appear to have survived into the Tertiary on the
Gulf coastal plain and the Pacific Coast respectively.

Among living forms Ι have noted a general similarity of the leaves of Ficus planicosdnla to a
number of genera: Cocculus (Cebatha) and [Iypcrboena of the Menispormaceae, Alchornca and
Mallotus os the Euphorbiaceae, Pterospermmn ,(Sterculiaceze), Hampca (Bonbacaccze), Colubrz'na
(Rhamnaceae), and Ficus (Moraceae). After consulting all available herbarium material of both
eastern and western hemisphere representatives of these genera at The New York Botanical
Garden, I am convinccd that the reference to Ficus is not only reasonable but probably correct.
A close resemblance was noted between the fossil specimens and the leaves of Ficus calubrinoe
Standley² of Guaternala and Ficus inteqrisolz'a E11n.³ of the Philippincs. Except for their re-
motely toothed margins the leaves of Ficus r'z‘edelii Miq.⁴ of Celebes are also ‹romparable.

There are about 10 specimens of this type, which are similar except in their slightly smaller
size to the figured and type specimens of this species. Ι was at first inclined to regard these
specimens as variants of Ficus planicostata. Among the large number of specimens of the latter
species, however, there are none which vary in the direction of the round, broad leaves of F.
cockerezli. The heart-shaped base and the venation of this species are also distinctive. There is
a resemblance to F. speciosissima Ward from the Mesaverde formation ⁵ and F. leez· Knowlton
from the V ermejo,⁵ which I believe are conspecific with each other. These, however, are decidedly
more beart-shaped at the base, are longer in proportion to their width, and possess notable dif-
ferences in both secondary and tertiary venation.

Ficus cockerelli is reported in the above citations to be questionably present in the Raton
flora and fairly common in both the Laramie and Black Buttes floras. It is said to occur also in
the VVilcox of the Gulf states.⁷ I have not seen the Wilcox specimens, which Berry more recently
has considered synonymous with Ficus missz'ssz‘ppoensis.⁸

Among modern leaves these specimens are in my opinion more similar to the leaves of
Cocculus, Cissampezos, and M cnispermum (Menispermaceae) than to any species of Ficus which I
have seen. Except for their thinner texture, it is difficult to distinguish the sossil specimens from
the leaves of Caeculus (Gabatha) carolinus (L.) DC.9
