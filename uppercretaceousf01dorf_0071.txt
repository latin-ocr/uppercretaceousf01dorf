FOX HILLS AND LOWER MEDICINE BOW 59

distinctive venation as in Crcdncrz'a protaphyllaides. With the possible exception of C. internmzzssa.‚1
which is unfortunately not completely known, none os the Alaskan forms arc entire-margines} and
they are therefore not apparently conspccific wit-h the Mcdicinc Bow and Vermcjo specics.

Among living forms, the widesprcad Cretaceous genus Crcdncrz‘a has apparently no closely
similar leaf forms. Venation characters and general shape and size seem to indicate assinities
with Platanus.²

Pisonia? racemosa Lesquereux
(Plate 9, Fig. 2)

Pisonia racemosa Lesquereux, U. S. Geol. and Geog. Surv. Terr., Ann. Rept. (1873), 400, 1874; Rept. U. S.
Geol. Surv. Terr.‚ vol. 7, 209, pl. 35, fig. 4, 1878.

The small, delicate cluster of seed-like bodies here figured is not distinguishable from the
specimens of this species from Black Buttes, Wyoming. Their exact nature is problematical and
their reference to Pv'sonz‘a is by no means definite, as Lesquereux clearly stated in his original
analysis. If they are seeds they are considerably smaller and wider at the base than any seeds of
Pisonz‘a (= Torrubz'a Vellozo) which I have been able to find for comparison. More and better
material will have to be obtained to make possible a definite systematic assignment.

Remains of this type are evidently rarely preserved, as they have not been recognized in
deposits other than those at the type locality and those of the Medicine Bow formation here
recorded.

Occurrence—North of Walcott, WVyoming, Loc. P. 373.

Genus CINNAMOMUM (Tournefort) Linne
Cinnamomum linifolium Knowlton
(Plate 9, Fig. 1)

Cinnamomum Zinisolium Knowlton, U. S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Paper 101, 319, pl. 88, figS. 3—7, 1917; idem, Prof.
Paper 155, 86, pl. 59, fig. 3, 1930.

This type of leaf is rare in the collections, being represented at two localities by only three
fragments, the best of which is here figured. It agrees in essentially all observable characters with
the description and type specimens of this species from the lower Raton and Dawson formatioris
of Colorado.

Knowlton has previously pointed out the general resemblance of this species to cinnamomum
oblofnqatzcm Berry and C. vera Berry from the Gulf Coast Eocene.³ To my knowledge there are no
other fossil forms known in North America with which even a general comparison can be made.

Knowlton was originally in doubt concerning the generic reference of this species. There is
unquestionably a resemblance to cinnamomum.. I have also found leaves of essentially the same
type in herbarium specimens of Cocculzts larvz'solius D.C., and Lindera caudata Benth.‚ of Asia.
More complete specimens will be necessary, however, before detailed comparisons can be made.
