There arc only two incomplcte specimens of this type in the collcctions. They arc suffi-
ciently well defined, however, to indicate that they arc not of the spreading, two-rankcd leaflcts
here referred to Sequoia nordenskz'oldi Heer.

The reference to S? acuminata Lesquereux is made on the basis of identity with the figured
and type specimens of the Laramie forms which Knowlton questionably referred to this specics,
and with the original types from Black Buttes, Wyoming. On the basis of material which Ι have
collected from the lower Lance formation near Glenrock, Wyoming, I am prepared to present
evidence in a forthcoming publication that this species is not distinct from Sequoz‘a Zonqisolia
Lesquereux, a conclusion which both Lesquereux and Knowlton recognized as a possibility in the
reports cited above.

After surveying herbarium materials of modern conifers, I am convinced that the reference
to Sequoia is invalid. My studies of the better material from the Lance formation have as yet
not revealed the true botanical relationship of the species.

Occurrence—Corson Ranch, Wyoming, Loc. P. 372; north of Walcott, Wyoming, Loc. P. 373.

Sequoia nordenskioldi Heer
(Plate 1, Fig. 10)

Sequoia nordenskibldi Heer, Fl. Foss. Arctica, vol. 2, pt. 3, 36, pl. 2, fig. 13b, pl. 4, figs. la, lb, 4-38, 1870;
Newberry, U. S. Geol. Sui-v. Mon. 35, 20, pl. 26, fig. 4, 1898.

There are about a dozen specimens which are indistinguishable from Heer's original type
figures of this species. The status of this species in North America is very unsatisfactory. In
the first place, it cannot be separated from the widespread Tertiary leaf species Sequoia lanysdorfiz'
(Brongm'art) Heer, which in turn is essentially similar to the living S. sempervirens Endlicher of
the Pacific Coast. In the second place, eones of Sequoia found in the same Cretaceous strata as
foliage referred partly to S. nordenskio'ldi, and partly to S. Zanysdorfii, have recently been described
as S. dakotensis Brown.l These cones are comparable to those of the living S. sempervz‘rens and
the Tertiary S. lctnysdorfii but are sufficiently different in significant characters to indicate that
they belong to a distinct species, though not to Heer's S. nordenskzbldi. It seems likely, therefore,
that the Sequoz‘a foliage which here and elsewhere is referred to S. ⁷207·dcnskz'6ldi is in reality the
foliage of the species whose eones are now called S. dakotensis. Until such time as the cones and
foliage may be found in direct connection, however, it seems best to retain the widely used name
S. rnorclenskz't‘ildz' for the late Cretaceous foliage of this type.

This species has been widely reported, though rarely figured, from the Lance and Fort Union
of the Rocky Mountain region. I doubt if it will ever have the stratigraphic significance which
can now be attached to species based on cone material.

Occurrence—Craig, Colorado, Loc. P. 375.

Family TYPHACEAE

Genus TYPHA Linne
Typha sp.
(Plate l, Fig. 12)
There are about a dozen well-preserved fragments which are clearly referable to the genus

Typha. The best of these, which is figured, shows the characteristic strong and weak parallel
veins crossed and connected irregularly by short, transverse veinlets.
