remote near the apex, consistently parallel, curving only slightly toward the margins where they
curve upward more abruptly and run into the margins ; secondaries near apex paralleling and
curving in toward the midrib; tertiaries fine and very closely spaced. flexuose percurrent, at ap-
proximately right angles to the seconda1·ies; very rarely, tertiary branches given off from the lower
sides of the secondaries near the margins; finer nervation not observable; margin usually entire,
slightly undulate, more rarely with blunt, inconspicuous, upward-pointing teeth near the apex ;
texture firm.

The characters of this type of leaf are so easily recognized and consistent that I feel no hesi-
tancy in referring Rhamnus brittoni and one specimen of R. rectfzssnervz‘s to the same species. I was
at first also inclined to include in it the specimens referred to R. qoldiaxnusst but find that in none
of my specimens is there any trace of the well-developed branching of the lower secondaries found
in that species. Knowlton has remarked upon the similarity of certain specimens from the Denver
flora referred to Berchemia multinervis (Al. Braun) Heer.² These are. however, of different shape
and do not possess the characteristic upper secondaries paralleling and curving in toward the
midrib. In the same report, Knowlton included in Rhamnus cleburm? the specimens which
Lesquereux had referred to Cornus studeri Heer?. These differ, however, in their more remote,
converging secondaries. which are usually forked near the leaf margins.

As previously recorded, Rhamnus cleburni and the species here included in it are known from
the Laramie, Denver, Dawson. Raton, and Black Buttes floras of the Rocky Mountain region.
It is also present in collections from the Lance of “ Converse County‚'' Wyoming. both at Princeton
University and the U. S. National Museum. It is not known to occur in the Fort Union floras of
western North America‚ but is reported, though unfortunately not figured, from the Eocene of
Oregon ³ and the Gulf Coast.⁴ Berry has pointed out “the similarity and possible identity” of
the Gulf Coast specimens to the variable leaves of Rhamnus coushatta Berry.⁵ It is in any event
apparent that both the Gulf and West Coast Eocene species are closely related to the late Cre-
taceous R. cleburm’, indicating a survival of descendant forms in regions outside the Rocky Moun-
tain area.

It is difficult to see any resemblance between the fossil leaves of Rhamnus cleburm' and the
leaves of modern species of Rhamnus. In my opinion, after consulting herbarium specimens at
The New York Botanical Garden, the fossil specimens are not referable to any living genus of the
family Rhamnaceae. On the other hand. their leaf characters are closely similar to several genera
of the family Dilleniacese. namely Davilla, Dillenia, Doliocarpus, and Tetracera. In Dillenia and
Tetracera the leaves are usually more regularly toothed along the whole margin than in the fossil
specimens. The leaves of Doliocarpus dentatus (Aubl.) Standley ⁶ of Central and South America
are practically indistinguishable in all details from the fossil specimens. Almost equally corn-
parable are the leaves of Davvilla multiflora St. Hil.‚⁷ which differ only in their slightly more obtuse
secondaries. Other genera which were consulted but eliminated because of marked differences
were Rhammssdium (Rhamnaceae), Cuphea (Lythraceae) and M ebzssosma (sabiaceae).
