FOX HILLS AND LOWER MEDICINE Bow 7

Lance age of the Medicine Bow formation has previously been discussed by Hares ¹
and substantiated by Dobbin and Reeside.²

NORTHWESTERN COLORADO

The plant remains from this region were obtained from the succession of sand-
stones, 5113105, and coal beds occupying the same stratigraphic position above the
Lewis shale as do the sediments of the Medicine Bow formation in southern Wyo-
ming. These sediments have hithertossbeen referred to the Laramie or “ Laramie’'
formation. In view of their closer geographie position to the type 1003111)ν of the
Medicine Bow formation than to that of the Laramie formation, as now restricted,
it seems more appropriate to refer them to the former formation. Such a reference
is further substantiated by the fact that the outcrop of these strata can be traced
with only slight breaks almost continuously from the area in northwestern Colorado
to the western part of the Hanna basin in southern Wyoming.

Attention in this region was centered about the area surrounding Craig,
C olorado‚ because of the previous reports of plant fossils in this region and because
of their occurrence in sediments conformably overlying beds which have yielded a
Fox Hills fauna, including the index ammonite Sphenodiscus ³ which has been used
throughout my work as a reference zone.

The first important contribution 10 1110 geology of this region was the report on
the Yampa coal field by Fenneman and Gale.4 The sediments conformably
overlying the Lewis shale were here referred to the Laramie formation on the basis
of stratigraphic position. A more comprehensive report by Gale on the 0031 fields
of northwestern Colorado and northeastern Utah was publishcd in 1910.⁵ The
name Laramie formation was still retained for the strata above the Lewis shale on
the basis of a few species of invertebrates and plants. In 1925, Hancock, ⁶ who was
followed by 80315,7 expressed doubt regarding the reference of these same beds to the
Laramie formation by placing the name in quotation marks Additional marine
invertebrateS, including the index species Sphenodiscus lenticulari& (5²), were ob-
tained by Hancock from the lower massive sandstones of his “ Laramie ’⁷ formation,
indicating the Fox Hills age of these beds. In the sections which we measured a
few miles west of C raig, additional Fox Hills species were collected from the massive
sandstones above the Lewis shale. The same criteria for the recognition of the Fox
Hills formation as were applied in southern Wyoming (see p. 6) were found to
obtain in this region.

All of the plant remains secured from this region were collected from horizons
in the lower Medicine Bow formation, lying within a few hundred feet above the
massive sandstones here referred to the Fox Hills formation. No attempt was made
to determine the upper limit of the Medicine Bow formation, although it clearly
