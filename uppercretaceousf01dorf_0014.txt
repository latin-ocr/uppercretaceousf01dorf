PRESENT PHYSICAL CONDITIONS AND VEGETATION

Of the 6 localities studjed, 4 are situated in southern Wyoming and the remain-
ing 2 in northwestern Colorado, as shown in figure 1. Both areas are essentially
alike in physical and climatic conditions and differ only in details With respect to
the type and distribution of vegetation.

These areas are included in the high, barren intermontane basins of the Rocky
Mountain system. Their average elevation ranges from approximately 5000 to
7000 feet. The topography is sub-maturely dissected, and largely controlled by the
differential erosion of variously dipping strata of unequal hardness. The southern
Wyoming region lies in the drainage area of the North Platte and Medicinc Bow
rivers, which are the only permanent streams. The Yampa River drains the area in
northwestern Colorado. Thc narrow flood plains of these streams are features of
primary importance in the distribution of modern vegetation.

On the basis of moisturc and temperature conditions these areas are near the
eastern edge of the cool, arid climatic province.l Normal annual precipitation
