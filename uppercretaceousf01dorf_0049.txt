Fox HILLS AND LOWER MEDICINE Bow 37

youngest marine zone of the Upper Cretaceous system of southern Wyoming and
northwestern Colorado.

In southern lVyoming the plant remains were collected from 4 localities in the
Hanna and Carbon basins. Here the plant horizons lie within the lower third of
the Medicine Bow formation. Measured sections indicate the exact positions of
the plant-bearing beds with reference to the marine Sphenodz'scus zone of Fox Hills
age. Evidence is presented for the recognition of the Fox Hills formation, on both
lithologic and palaeontologic grounds, in the strata formerly referred to the upper
Lewis or basal Medicine Bow formations.

In northwestern Colorado the plant remains were obtained from 2 localities
near Craig from beds previously referred to the “Laramie” formation. The basal
sandy beds of this formation have yielded marine invertebrateS‚ including the
diagnostic F ox Hills ammonite, Sphenodiscus. On the basis of stratigraphic, litho-
logic, and palaeontologic evidence the section is divided into the Medicine Bow
formation above and the Fox Hills formation below, the latter lying conformably
above the Lewis shale as in southern Wyoming.

The plant remains from the 6 localities are treated as a unit, referred to as
the lower Medicine Bow flora. Of the 64 recognizable forms 47 are referred to
species previously described elsewhere, 11 are described as new species, and 6 are
recorded as not specifically determinable. It is recognized that many of the generic
references are of doubtful botanic validity. Although more plausible generic alter-
natives are suggested for most of the species, few changes in nomenclature have
been made because of the lack of corroborative proof at the present time. In some
species the large suites of specimens obtained have made possible new descriptions
and revisions of synonymous forms. From a quantitative viewpoint 11 species
are shown to be dominants on the basis of abundance of individual leaves and
occurrence at the largest number of localities.

The structural characters of the dicotyledonous leaves in the flora indicate
warm temperate to subtropical conditions of growth, more nearly approaching the
latter. Similar climatic implications are shown by the modern distribution of
families and genera whose systematic positions appear certain, and of generic
alternatives suggested by similarities between the fossil leaves and those of living
genera.

The age of the lower Medicine Bow formation is rather definitely established
by its stratigraphic position, its relation to the Sphenodiscus zone and to Triceratops-
bearing beds, and its associated fresh-water molluscs. The Laramie and lower
Lance (Hell Creek member) floras are shown to be most nearly similar to that of
the lower Medicine Bow and are considered essentially contemporaneous. This
conclusion is supported by the relation of both the Laramie and the lower Lance
formatioris to the Sphenocliscus zone and Tri'ceratops-bearing beds. From a pre—
liminary study of the Lance floras it seems evident that the Hell Creek flora is
essentially of Laramie—lower Medicine Bow aspect (Upper Cretaceous) and the
upper Lance (Tullock and Ludlow members) flora is of Fort Union (Paleocene)
character. The latter reference is in harmony with the evidence of the vertebrate
