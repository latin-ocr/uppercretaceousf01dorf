rather than 3 hasal primarios. They cannot he distinguished from the Laramie specimcns which
Knowlton called Zizyphus henam-soni. The specimen os Z. colorudcnszsss, whi‹·h Ι have examined
at the U. S. National Museum, is clearly the same species, 511100 it does not show any trace of
upper marginal teeth, as Knowlton suspected.

This 5000105 15 at present known only from the Laramic and Medicine Bow formatioris.

I have been unable to find any modern leaves with which this 5000105 can be compared.

Occurrence—Corson Ranch, WVyoming, Loc. P. 372; north of Walcott, Wyoming, Loc. P.
373; Elk Mountain road, XVyoming, Loc. P. 374.

(Plate 13, Figs. 2, 3)

In the field collections there were 27 specimens of this type, which were consistent in shape,
average size, and venation. Four of the better specimens were retained for study.

Descriptfmz—Leaves oval to elliptic, widest just below the middle, obtusely wedge-shaped
at the base, and gradually narrowed to a slightly elongate, acuminate tip; length 6 to 9 cm.; width
3 to 5 0111.; petiole at least 1.2 010. long; secondaries tri-nerved from just below the base of the
blade, the laterals almost as heavy as the midrib, and given off at an angle of 200; next pair of
secondaries branching from the midrib just below the middle; these and the widely spaced sec-
ondaries above are acute, slightly curved upward, and forking toward the margin forming loops
vn‘th the secondaries or their branches above; 3 to 4 prominent forking tertiaries along the lower
edge of the lateral basal secondaries, and usually one tertiary well developed from the upper edges ;
margin entire, palmately lobed by 2 pairs of shallow, narrow, rounded sinuses; central lobe largest,
symmetrically oval; lateral lobes smaller and asymmetrical, texture subcoriaceous.

This 5000105 shows only a general resemblance to other fossil species of Cissites from North
America. The closest similarity is with C. colyatensis Brown, which, however, is uniformly smaller,
more distinctly loheel, and of an entirely different shape.¹ The resemblance to C. panduratus
Knowlton from the Vermejo formation 15 also apparent though more remote.² It is, however,
similar to specimens from the Lance of “Converse County,’' Wyoming, which Knowlton tenta-
tively called Ficus? lobata Knowlton in an unpublished manuscript at the U. S. National Museum.

In the attempt to determine the probable botanical affinities of this type of leaf Ι have sur-
veyed all available herbarium material at The New York Botanical Garden of the following fami-
lies: Araliaceae, Magnoliaceae, Moraceae, Sterculiaceae, and Vitaceae. The practice of referring
leaves of this general form to Cis-sites, implying relationship to the genus Cissus (Vitaceae), is in a
measure substantiated by the leaf characters of several living species of that genus, notably C.
rhombfz’solia (sheet No. 557). A general resemblance was also seen to the variable leaves of
Piero-spermum proteus Burkill (sheet No. 10120) of the Sterculiaceae. No exact duplicate of the
fossil specimens has yet been seen in any of the families studied.
