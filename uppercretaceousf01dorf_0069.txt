FOX HILLS AND LOWER MEDICINE BOW 57

Knowlton.l The type specimens of both of thcsc species arc not distinguishablc in any way from
my specimens nor from the specimen of Cornus proezssmpressa. I havc not seen thc actual specimen
of Rhamnites knowlto'nz' froin the Lance formation, but the figure seems quite unlike the type
specimens of this species from thc Eocene of the Gulf Coastf aud is not distinguishahle from the
specimens here referred to Ficus cros-sii. Such a reference is substantiated by the presence of
several indistinguishable leaves in a collection which I recently made from the lower Lance near
Ekalaka, Montana. In view of the discovery of more complete spccimcns than hitherto known,
it seems desirablc to amplify the descriptions previously given of this specics.

Description (Supplementc1ry)—Leaves elliptic to oval, with a broadly cuneate base and
abruptly short-acuminate tip; length 8 to 10 cm.; width 5 to 6 cm.; midrib thick in depth, especially
below, straight or very slightly curved; secondaries about 10—12 pairs, mainly alternate. at an
angle of about 600 near the base to as low as 350 near the apex. slightly curved upward. unbranched,
camptodrome, arching upward just inside the margin5 tertiary veins fairly strong, mainly un-
broken, at angles of 900 to the midrib near the apex to as low as 650 to the midrib in the lower half;
finer veins forming an irregular meshwork; margin entire; texture firm.

This species as now known is present in the Mesaverde. Colgate, Laramie. lower Lance. and
lower Medicine Bow formationS, with the closely related Rhamm'tes knowltom' occurring in the
Eocene of the Gulf Coast. There do not appear to be any Fort Union species with which confusion
might result.

Among living forms there appear to be very few species of Ficus with leaves of this general
character. I have surveyed the following genera at The New York Botanical Garden as alternae
tive possibilities for comparison: Anona (Anonaceae), Cornus and Nyssa (Cornaceae), Ficus
(Moraceae), M aynolia (Magnoliaceae)‚ Rha-mnus (Rhamnaceae)‚ Cephalanthos (Rubiaceae). and
Diospyros (Ebenaceae). The closest resemblance among these genera was with M aqnozz'a,
particularly M. virginiana L. (= M. ylauca L.) and the smaller leaves of M. yraxrzdz'flora L.

Ficus tesselata Lesquereux
(Plate 6. Fig. 2)
Ficus tesselata Lesquereux (MS). Knowlton. U. S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Paper 101, 266, pl. 41, fig. 5, 1917.

The collections contain only 2 fairly complete specimens and several fragments of this type
of leaf. These are essentially similar to the figured and type specimen of Ficus tesselata from the
Vermejo formation. Knowlton has pointed out the resemblance to Rhamnus salicz'solius Les-
quereux,³ from which it differs decidedly in its shape, its fewer, more acute secondaries, and its
open tertiary venation. It seems even closer to Laurus lanceolata Knowlton from the Laramie
and Dawson formations.⁴ The known specimens of this species, unfortunately, are too few and
too fragmentary to make possible a detailed comparison.

Knowlton has recorded Ficus tesselata also from the Lance formation in an unpublished
manuscript at the U. S. National Museum.

I can see little justification for the reference of this species to the genus Ficus. In a complete
survey of both eastern and western hemisphere species of Ficus at The New York Botanical
Garden I was unable to find any leaf forms with comparable characters. The family Lauraceae‚
on the other hand, contains many comparable leaf forms. chiefly in the genus Nectandra (cf.
N. ylauca ⁵ and N. cuspidata ⁵ of South America).
