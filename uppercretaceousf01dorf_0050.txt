saunas but is contradictory to the reputed Upper Cretaceous age of the Cannonball
marine member of the Lance, which corresponds to the Tullock member in its
position above the Hell Creek.

Other formatioris in the Rocky Mountain region whose floras are shown to
be comparable in character and age to that of the lower Medicine Bow formation
are the so-called “Laramie” of Black Buttes, Wyoming and part of the Denver-
Dawson beds and of the Vermejo-Raton sequence of Colorado.

The extensive F ort Union flora of the Rocky Mountain region is considered
to have little in common with that of the lower Medicine Bow. The often-quoted
statement that the Fort Union and Lance floras are essentially similar in aspect is

shown to be not strictly true.

SYSTEMATIC PALAEOBOTANY

GENERAL PROCEDURE

In view of the preponderance of leaves in nearly all occurrences of fossil plant
remmus, it is only natural that the governing principle for taxonomic work is
that the leaves of trees and shrubs are sufficiently well-defined, diagnostic, and
constant within genera and species to make identification possible. There are,
of course, exceptional cases such as the modern Sassafras officinale Nees and
Ebermaier, whose leaf form varies normally from entire to simply lobate to doubly
lobate. Fossil specimens of such variable leaf forms of a single species might
conceivably lead to their identification as three distinct species. Were it possible
to obtain a large suite of such specimens, however, showing intergradations be-
tween the leaf forms, they would properly be designated a single species. Modern
palaeobotanic technique clearly recognizes leaf variability within certain limits of
both modern and fossil species. In a thousand leaves from a single modern tree
there may be found a dozen variations in size or shape or other leaf characters.
Systcmatically arranged, however, these variants usually are constantin other
characters, such as margin, venation‚ or character of the base or tip. In dealing
with fossil specimens the normal variants of a single species can likewise be recog-
nized, provided that a sufficient number of specimens are collected and studied‚
To achieve the most reliable identificationS, therefore, it is desirable to obtain as

large a suite of specimens of each fossi] leaf type as is practicable.

In the taxonomic study of the Medicine Bow floras the collections were first
sorted in the field into provisional species, based on similarity of leaf forms. From
each suite of provisional species a representative suite of variants was next selected,
if available, and shipped for laboratory study. Each selected specimen was then
compared and contrasted with published descriptions and illustrations of the
numerous Upper Cretaceous and carly Tertiary species of North America. Where
similarities scemcd unquestionable the specimens wcre compared with the type
specimens, nearly all of which arc in the collections of the U. S. National Museum.
In the larger suites of provisional species, it has often been possible to show that
certain leaf types previously regarded as distinct species were merely variants of
another specics. In the case of Ficus planicoscata, for example, Ι was faced with
