to show a closer relationship to the underlying Fox Hills fauna of the Upper Creta-
ceous than to any known early Tertiary fauna.¹

Summary—-The evidence of the floras here discussed substantiates to a con—
siderable degree the correlation of late Cretaceous and early Tertiary formatioris
suggested previously by other lines of evidence. Figure 8 shows the generally

accepted correlation chart of the formatioris involved, modified from Miss Wil-
marth's charts as suggested by the U. S. Geological Survey.2 F urther proposed
changes based on the present floral studies, indicated by dotted lines and arrows,
are the Laramie age of part of the Vermejo-Raton sequence and the Fort Union
age of the Cannonball7 Tullock and Ludlow members of the Lance formation. The
present study supports the conclusion of Dane and Pierce that the lower Dawson
and the Arapahoe—lower Denver should be referred to the Upper Cretaceous.
