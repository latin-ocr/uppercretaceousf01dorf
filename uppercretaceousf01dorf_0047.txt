relationships.

Vermejo—Ralon floras—The Vermejo and Raton floras were described by
Knowlton1 as two distinct floras occurring in beds which were separated by a
definite unconformity. Although Ι have not visited this region, it seems apparent
from the published descriptions of sections that the evidence for the unconformity
can in most cases be interpreted as due to local stream-channeling. Table 4 shows
that there are 12 and 11 Medicine Bow species in common with the Verniejo and
Raton floras, respectively. In my opinion, this indicates that the unconformity,
if it does exist, represents very little if any hiatus. If the Vermejo-Raton floras are
combined they possess 20 species in common with the flora of the lower Medicine
Bow formation, suggesting that at least a portion of the Vermejo-Raton sequence
is of lower Medicine Bow age. In the Vermejo flora there are, to be sure, floral
elements that suggest an age slightly older than Laramie or lower Medicine Bow.
This is consistent with the upper Pierre rather than F ox Hills age assignment of
the Trinidad sandstone, which lies conformably below the VermejO. On the other
hand, there are a number of Paleocene species in the Raton floras, suggesting that,
as in the case of the Denver-Dawson beds, the lower portion of the Raton formation
may be Cretaeeous and the upper portion Paleocene and possibly younger.

Fort Union flora—The extensive Fort Union flora of the Rocky Mountain
region is well known though in need of critical restudy, which is at present being
undertaken by Dr. Roland W. Brown of the U. S. Geological Survey. Knowlton 2
regarded the Lance and F ort Union floras as essentially similar, a view which has
often been quoted in geological reports and textbooks. In view of the close rela-
tionship now established between the lower Lance and the lower Medicine Bow
floras, it is therefore surprising to find only two species in common between the
lower Medicine Bow and Fort Union floras. This somewhat anomalous situation
is in part explained by the discovery, as discussed under the Lance flora above,
that some of Knowlton's so-called Lance collections were obtained from strata now
conclusively known to be within the F ort Union formation. It has also become
apparent that the lower Lance (Hell Greek) flora is quite distinct from that of the
upper Lance (Tullock and Ludlow). The former is clearly of Laramje-lower Medi-
cine Bow aspect, whereas the latter is more closely related to the flora of the Fort
Union. If this tentative observation is substantiated by further studies of the
Lance floras which Ι have already under way, it brings into harmony the evidence
of the plants and the vertebrates in placing the greatest faunal and fioral break at
the end of lower Lance (Hell Creek) time.³ This is still not in agreement with the
evidence afforded by marine invertebrates, since the Cannonball member of the
Lance, which overlies the Hell Creek member, has yielded a fauna which is said
