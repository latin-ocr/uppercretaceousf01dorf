Family SCHIZAEACEAE
Genus ΑΝΕΙΜΙΑ Swartz

Aneimia sp.

(Plate 1, Fig. 8)

The single unsatisfactory specimen figured is the only one of this form in the collections.
It is clearly quite different from the other ferns but is unfortunately lacking in the characters
essential for reliahle identification.

The size, shape‚ and arrangement of the pinnules seem to relate this form to several recorded
fossil species of Aneimia (usually misspelled Anemz'a). It differs from A. elonqata (Newberry)
Knowlton, from the Laramie and Mesaverde formations of Colorado and Wyoming‚l only in
possessing crenate rather than coarsely toothed margins. It is equally close to A. mosboyensis
Knowlton from the Dawson formation ² and A. supercretacea Hollick from the Vermejo.³ The
marginal crenations are also apparently the main difference between our specimen and the figure
of A. occidentalis Knowlton from the Raton formation.⁴ Ι believe that if large, complete speci-
mens of any of these species could be collected they might conceivably show all of the variations
on a single frond which at present are considered specific differences.

The reference of all of the specimens cited to the genus Anefz‘fmvia seems open to question.
In so far as leaf morphology is concerned they might equally well be referred to Asplem'um, Poly-
podium, or Pteris. In the absence of diagnostic fruiting structures, however, it is impossible to
attempt a more accurate determination.

Occurrence—Corson Ranch, Wyoming‚ Loc. P. 371.

Family EQUISETACEAE
Genus EQUISETUM Linne

Equisetum sp.

(Plate 1, Figs. 9, 13)

The collections contain a half dozen specimens which consist in part of ribbed, jointed stems
and in part of tubers connected with jointed stems. The preserved characters do not seem to me
to be sufficiently diagnostic to attempt a specific determination. The reference to qucisetum,
however, seems rather certain.

There appear to be very few figured specimens of comparable jointed stems from the late
Cretaceous or early Tertiary of the Rocky Mountain region. It may be that our specimcns might
be comparable to several forms from the Lance or Denver, which are, unfortunately. listed simply
as Equisetum sp.,⁵ and not figured. The tubers, on the other hand, are very similar to those of
Equisetum perloeviqatum Cockerell from the Laramie formation of Colorado.⁶ Close resemblance
of such generalized portions of plants as underground tubers does not, however, seem to justify
their being considered conspecific, or their being used for correlation purposes.

Occurrence—Corson Ranch, Wyoming‚ Locs. P. 371, P. 372.

Collection—U. C. Mus. Pal„ Nos. 1293, 1294.
