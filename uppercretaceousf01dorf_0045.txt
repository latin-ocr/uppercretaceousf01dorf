and palzeobotanic evidence to indicate essential contemporaneity between the
Laramie formation of the Denver basin and at least the lower third of the Medicine
Bow formation.

Lance flora—Table 4 shows that there are 26 species in common between the
Lance flora and that of the lower Medicine Bow formation. This is almost as
great a similarity as between the Laramie and the Medicine Bow flora. Morfflwer,
this similarity must by simple mathematical deduction lead to the conclusion that
the Lance and Laramie floras are more nearly contemporaneous than has ever
previously been admitted. Knowlton maintained that the Lance flora was dis-
tinctly younger than that of the Laramie,l although he admitted that tho Lance
flora had not at that time been adcquately described and that there was consider-
able uncertainty attached to some of the localities from which Lance plants had
been collected. In an attempt to remedy both of these situations Ι have begun a
detailed field and laboratory study of the Lance flora, which to date has yielded
the following preliminary observations: (1) Of the 58 recorded localities ² of reputed
Lance plants, 14 localities are definitely at horizons in the Fort Union formation,
8 are definitely and 7 probably in the Tullock or Ludlow member of the Lance,
11 are definitely and 9 probably in the Hell Creek member of the Lance, 1 is defi-
nitely in the Colgate member of the F ox Hills sandstone, and the remaining 8
localities are of very doubtful stratigraphic or geographie position; (2) the list of
Lance plant species published by Knowlton in 1919 ³ was at that date neither
complete nor reliable, and must be completely revised to be of scientific value;
(3) the treatment of the Lance flora as a single unit flora will lead to further con-
fusion3 pending a more thorough investigation, it is apparent even in a preliminary
enumeration of species that the flora of the Hell Creek member of the Lance is
more closely allied to that of the Laramie, Medicine Bow, Colgate, etc., of the
latest Cretaeeous, whereas the floras of the Tullock and Ludlow members of the
Lance are of F ort Union (Paleocene) facies; (4) the only thorougth reliable infor-
mation regarding the Lance flora is that of Berry ⁴ and Brown ⁵ on floras from the
Hell Creek member; neither of these floras includes elements of Fort Union aspect.

Despite the confused state of the Lance flora, it has been possible to show a
close relationship between the lower Medicine Bow flora and that of the Lance,
mainly from the collections of Brown and Berry at the U. S. National Museum,
and from my own collections at Princeton University. All of these collections are
from the lower or Hell Creek member of the Lance, suggesting essential contem-
poraneity between the lower Lance, lower Medicine Bow, and Laramie formatioris.
Here is convincing corroboration of our basic assumptions, since the lower Lance,
like the Laramie and the lower Medicine Bow, is conformably just above the Fox
