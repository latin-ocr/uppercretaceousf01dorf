34 CONTRIBUTIONS To PALAEONTOLOGY

Hills sandstone yielding Sphenodiscus lenticularis,¹ and is below or within the zone
of abundant Trz‘ceratops remains. Further discussion of the stratigraphic and
fioral problems of the Lance will be presented in later papers.

Black Buttes flora—With 20 species common to the Medicine Bow formation,
the flora from near Black Buttes in southwestern Wyoming is apparently com-
parable‚ though not necessarily exactly contemporaneous. The Black Buttes flora
occurs in the so-called “Laramie’' formation (Black Buttes coal group),² which
in this region is said to lie stratigraphically just above the Lewis shale. Knowlton
has given an excellent historical review of the work on this flora.³ Although he at
one time considered the flora of true Laramie age and equivalent to that of the
Hell Creek member (“Ceratops beds'’) of the Lance} Knowlton in his later years
was inclined to regard it as younger than the Laramie, and considered the beds to
lie unconformably on the massive sandstones (Fox Hills?) at the top of the Lewis
shale.⁵ Ι visited the Black Buttes region during the summer of 1936 and failed to
find any evidence of the unconformity which Knowlton had proposed. Until a
complete restudy and revision of the stratigraphy, palaeontology, and palaeobotany
of this section is completed, it will be impossible to make a definite age determina-
tion of the flora. The high degree of similarity to the floras of the lower Medicine
Bow formation cannot, however, be overlooked, and suggests similar age for at
least some of the plant-bearing horizons of the Black Buttes group.

Denver-Dawson floras—There are 17 species in common between the floras of
the Denver and associated formations ⁶ and those of the lower Medicine Bow.
This is considered a sufficiently large number of species to indicate that at least a
part of the Denver-Dawson beds are of lower Lance-Laramie age. Until a few years
ago such a statement might have been considered absurd, since it was supposed that
both the Dawson and the Denver (with its basal Arapahoe) were separated from
the underlying Laramie by a great unconformity representing a hiatus of sufficient
length to remove 14,000 feet of sedimentary rocks from the mountains to the west
of the region.⁷ Dane and Pierce 8 have recently shown that the Arapahoe-Denver
sequence is equivalent in position and presumably in age to the Dawson, and that
the great unconformity is at best of local stream—channel origin. It is, therefore,
not unreasonable to expect Laramie species to extend into the Denver or Dawson.
Of the 17 lower Medicine Bow species which occur in the Denver-Dawson, only
four species in fact do not occur also in the underlying Laramie.

There are still many apparent differences between the large Denver-Dawson
floras and those of the lower Lance, lower Medicine Bow, and Laramie formations.
As Dane and Pierce have indicated, “the upper parts of the Dawson and Denver
may possibly include beds of Eocene age.’' ⁹ More careful collecting will be neces-
