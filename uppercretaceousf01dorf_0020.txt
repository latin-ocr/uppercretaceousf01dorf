includes all but the basal 475 feet of what has hitherto been termed the “ Laramie'’
formation. The “Laramie'’ has previously been separated by a persistent¹ con-
glomerate from the overlying Post-“Laramie’' (Fort Um‘on?) formation. The
validity of the Post-“Laramie’' formation as a separate lithologic unit has as yet
not been fully corroborated by fossil evidence.

The changes in the interpretation of the stratigraphic sequence in this region
are shown in Figure 3. The formations below the Mesaverde group and above the
Wasatch formation have been omitted as irrelevant to the present problem.
