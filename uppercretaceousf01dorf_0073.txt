Laurus socialis Lesquereux, Rept. U. S. Geol. Surv. Tcrr., vol. 7, 213, pl. 36, figs. 1—4, 7, 1878; Knowlton,
U. S. Geol. Surv, Prof. Paper 101, 317, pl. 91, fig. 5, 1917; idem, Prof. Paper 155, 85, pl. 38, fig. 4, 1930.

There are only 3 fragmentary specimens of this type in the eolleetions. They are referred
with doubt to this species. The spceimens are closely similar to those from the Raton and Denver
formations, which seem 10 me, however, to differ considerably from the original type speeiinens
from Evanston, Wyoming. In these the shape is more lanceolate and the seeondaries are more
numerous, more obtuse, and less prominently looped near the borders. Except for their more
obtuse secondaries, the leaves of L. socialis are also comparable to those of L. attaliensis Lesquercux ¹
from the Raton formation. It seems probable that at least the Denver and Medicine Bow speci-
mens should be described as a new species. In the absence of better and more numerous speei-
mens, however, a revision and description cannot be made at the present time.

In addition to Evanston, Raton, Denver, and Dawson occurrences reported above, Laurus
socialis is found also in the Livingston formation of Montana.²

Among modern leaves the lauraceous genera appear to resemble those of Laurus socialis
most closely. Several species of Persea and Laurus with similar leaf characters have been noted.
Laurus nobilis Linne, for example, has leaves of essentially similar shape and venation. An even
closer comparison may be noted in the leaves of Persea cardinensis (L.) Nees.³ A general re-
semblance is also apparent with leaves of M aqnolia (Magnoliaceae) and Diospyros (Ebenaceae).

Occurrence—Elk Mountain road, Wyoming, Loc. P. 374.

The imposing synonymy of this species is the continuation of the attempt to revise the stat-us
of the variable leaves usually referred to species of Populus. That this task is not completed is
indicated in part by 3 recent list given to me by Dr. R. W. Brown of the U. S. Geological Survey,
in which he tentatively assigns eleven additional species of the Denver flora to the above species.
I have not included these species for want of complete specimens of them sor comparisons.
