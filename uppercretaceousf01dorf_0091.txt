The only described fossil form which Ι have found comparablc to this specics is Zz'zysldzzzs
meet-ii Lesquerenx from the Hanna formation of Carbon, Wyoming.¹ There arc easily recognized
differences, howcvcr, in shape, texture, marginal tceth, and vcnation, which wcrc more apparent
in the comparison with the actual type specimens than with Lcsqucrcux's figures.

The specific name given to this species implies a closc resemblance to thc leaves of Colubrina
(Rhamnaceae), particularly C. asiatica. Brongn. and C. pubescens Kurz. The specimens arc also
comparablc in general to leaves of Zizyphus and paliurus of 1110 same family.

Phyllites sp.
(Plate 18, Fig. 1)

There are several fragments and the fairly complete specimen figured which apparently are
quite distinct from any other leaf form in the collections. I have not been able to identify this
type either generically or specifically. The general shape and character of the venation suggest
a reference to the genus Styrax. The specimen is included mainly for future reference.

Paloeoastere similis Knowlton, U. S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Paper 130, 168, pl. 24, figs. 10, 11, 1922.

The 2 specimens figured are the only representatives of this unique species in the collections.
Each consists of a whorl of segments or “leaves’' apparently eight or ten in number, joined at the
base and free at the apex, to form a spheroidal mass. Each segment is traversed longitudinally
by a deep median furrow or rib, and perpendicularly from the midrib to the margin by closely
spaced, subparallel, wavy lines. These are precisely the diagnostic features of Paloeoaster in-
quirenda from the Vermej0 and Raton formatioris. The same characters are present in the Lara-
mie specimens of P. 3? similis, which Knowlton maintained as distinct because of its fewer segments
and its attachment to a stalk. The presence of 4 segments in the exposed half of the Laramie
specimen would seem to me to imply the existence of an approximately equal number in the unex-
posed half, bringing the total number of segments to 8 01 01010, rather than 5 or ὃ 35 Knowlton
reported. The attachment to a stalk seems equally fortuitous‚ and of doubtful taxonomic sig-
nificance. I have therefore regarded the 2 species as synonymous.

I hesitate to separate either of these species from Sterculiocarpus coloradensz‘s Berry from
the Dawson (?) formation.² This species differs mainly in the presence of longitudinal ridges
rather than furrows along the median line of the segments. Ι 310 inclined toward the view ex-
pressed by Berry that remains of this type are seed capsules rather than of soliar nature. I have
been unable to find any modern forms with which these specimens might be compared.

During the past year I obtained an excellent limonitized specimen of this same unusual seed
capsule (‘?) from the Lance formation near Glendive‚ Montana. The specimen was collected and
sent to Professor G. L. Jepsen of Princeton Um‘versity by Mr. O. T. Lewis of Helena, Montana.

Occurrence—North of Walcott, Wyoming, Loc. P. 373.
