This type of leaf is not abundant, being represented by only 6 specimens from 3 localities.
None of these is perfectly complete, but enough is preserved to show that these can not be sepa·
rated from the type specimens (not figured by Knowlton) of Ficus trinervis, and the figured and
type specimens erroneously referred to cinnamomum affine which Knowlton properly referred to
Ficus trivervis. Knowlton justifiably distinguished these specimens from cinnamomum (1 ffine by
the character of the 103531 secondaries, which “pass to extreme base of the blade and arise with and
at the same point as the midrib.'' ¹ In his report on the Vermejo flora Knowlton subsequently
described what 116 called a very closely related species, Ficus proetrinervis, which he distinguished
from F. trinervis by a slight outward arching of the basal secondaries in the upper half of the blade.
Since this minor difference does not appear to be consistent in my specimens or in the type speci-
mens or duplicates at the U. S. National Museum, I feel justified in uniting these two species.

The characters which appear to be diagnostic of Ficus trinervz‘s are as follows: shape broadly
ovate to ovate-lanceolate; obtuse to slightly acuminate tip, and abruptly rounded decurrent base;
tri-nerved from below the actual base of the blade, so that the basal laterals form the margin of
the leaf down to the. petiole ; margin entire; lateral secondaries given off from the midrib at very
acute angles, almost paralleling the midrib and finally joining the next secondaries above by
marginal loops. The four species listed above as synonymous with F. triuervz‘s all possess this
same set of characters.

As now known, Ficus tr‘i'nervis is present in the Medicine Bow, Mesaverde, Vermejo, Fruit-
land, Baton, Laramie, Lance, Denver, Dawson, and Black Buttes floras. To my knowledge it
has never been reported in beds of indisputable Paleocene or later age.

The generic reference of this species to Ficus has in no way been substantiated by my survey
of all species of this genus in the herbarium of The New York Botanical Garden. The general
shape, margin, and venation of the fossil leaves are, in my opinion, more likely menispermaceouS,
yet Ι have been unsuccessful in finding a single species of this family in which the leaves are
basally decurrent.

Specimens of this type of leaf are not common but are usually rather well preserved. The
specimen herc figured is virtually complete in all details, which are similar to the specimens referred
to the 5 distinct species above. It should be pointed out that the figures of Ficus crossii and
Cornus emmonsz'i were not correctly drawn nor properly restored, as has been previously noted by

¹ Knowlton, F. H.. U. S. Geol. Surv. Eun. 163, 43, 1900.
