FOX HILLS AND LOWER MEDICINE Bow ().’)

The systematic status of this type of seed is still nnsoulml. Lesquereux regarded it as a
palm, and Knowlton was inclined toward Nyssa, though 110 later 1·‹›0‹›11.<i‹1‹›r‹=‹l and gave it the non-
committal name Rerrya, apparently unaware that this name was preoveupied and that Berry was
at that precise time ‹leseribing the same type of seed from the Wileox beds as Lewmnsnasstcs
arachioides minor, implying leguminous affinities. Quite recently num-11¹ has pointed out the
troehodendraceous character of the fossil specimens and their usual association, as in the Medicine
Bow formation, with leaves referred to Trochodcndroides.

FAMILY ANACARDIACEAE
Genus PISTACIA Linne

pistacia eriensis Knowlton

(Plate 19, Fig. 7)

Pistacia eriensz's Knowlton, U. S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Paper 130, 150, pl. 28, figs. 1-1, 1922.
Pvistaezta Jzollvtcki Knowlton, ibid., 151, pl. 28, figs. 5, 6.

There are 4 leaves with attached leaflets and 3 detached leaflets which are indistinguishable
from the Laramie specimens referred to P'z'stac‘ia e'riensz's. Two of the spec-iniens, one of which is
figured, are somewhat larger than any of the Laramie specimens but are otherwise similar.

In view of the very slight differences in size and arrangement between Pistacia criensis and
P. holbz'cki, and the fact that the specimens all come from one locality, there seem to be no grounds
for maintaining two distinct species. Knowlton referred to them as “obviously related and
possibly identical.'’ ² No other fossil forms appear to be comparable, although the large leaves
from the same Laramie locality which Knowlton described as J uylans newberryi ³ might ultimately
prove to be variants of pistacia eriensz's, since their shape and venation are remarkably similar.

Knowlton referred this species to the genus Pz‘stacia with considerable certainty, on the basis
of similar arrangement, shape, and venation to pistacia. lentiscus Linne and P. mattea F rick and
Meyer of Southern Europe. The resemblance is indeed close, although equally good comparisons
can be made with species of Rhus, belonging to the same family, and with J hylaris of the Jug-
landaceae. In the absence of conclusive evidence, however, it does not seem desirable to make
any change in the name at the present time.

Occurrence—Corson Ranch, Wyoming, Locs. P. 371, P. 372 ; north of Walcott, Wyoming,
