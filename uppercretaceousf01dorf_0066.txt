f H The specimens from Black Buttes, Wyoming were originally described by Lesquereux as
o ows:

“Leaves of medium size, subcoriaceous, entire, elliptical or broadly oval, slightly acuminate
or obtuse, rounded to a short⁷ thick, petiole, palmately three-nerved from the top of the petiole,
rarely from a short distance above the base; primary and secondary nerves broad, flat, all campto-

drome, as well as their divisions.''

Leaves of precisely this description are by far the most abundant of all species in the Medicine
Bow collections. Over 50 specimens of complete or nearly complete leaves were collected for
study. In arranging this suite for identification it was apparent that there was a perfect series
from small ones 1.2 by 2 cm. in dimensions to very large ones 7 by 12 cm. It was also found possi-
ble to match individual specimens perfectly with the figures and type specimens of each of the
species listed in the above synonymy. These various species had been distinguished from Ficus
planicostata by minor details, chiefly of venation, but were in each case discussed as difficult to
separate from that species. They are here regarded as mere variants of the average leaf form.

In 1923 Berry discussed the difficulties involved in the taxonomic separation of leaves of this
type and concluded that Ficus planicostata and its varieties were best considered conspeeific with
Ficus missz‘ssippz'ensis (Lesquereux) Β8ῙἹὙ.1 Ι11 comparisons of my large suite with all available
specimens of both these species and others at the U. S. National Museum I have found, however,
that the following criteria can serve to distinguish them:

Ficus planicostata Ficus mississz'ppiensis
l. Size: 1. Size:
Average less than 10 cm. long. Average more than 10 cm. long.
2. Shape: 2. Shape:
Always elliptical or broadly oval, widest near the Always ovate or ovate-lanceolate, widest well

3. Tip: 3. Tip:

point. middle of the leaf to a long, slender point.
4. Venation: 4. Venation:
Lateral primaries basilar. Lateral primaries suprabasilar.

It must be admitted, of course, that it is largely a matter of taxonomic judgment as to which
characters of leaves are more or less important in distinguishing one species from another. In this
case, however, I feel that my conclusions were inevitable because of the constancy with which the
listed characters were maintained in so large a collection of leaves of all sizes.

As here conceived, Ficus planicostata is a valuable index of late Cretaceous deposits in the
Rocky Mountain region, though it may possibly range into the early Paleocene. It makes its
first appearance in the upper Mesaverde formation of Wyoming, is well represented in the Vermejo‚
Raton, Fruitland, and Animas formatioris, and is abundant in the Laramie, Denver, and Black
Buttes floras. Although it has been reported from only one locality in the Lance,² I have seen
other specimens of it from the Lance of “Converse County,” Wyoming, at the U. S. National
Museum, which Knowlton referred to Phyllites ficisolia, new species.³ The species has never been
found in beds of indisputable Paleocene age, although collections from such beds, namely the Fort
Union formation, are very extensive. Related descendants of this species, such as Ficus vnissz'ssz‘p-
