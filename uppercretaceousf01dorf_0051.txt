1110 alternative of referring the large suite of specimens of this leaf type either to
8 species or to 1 species. The latter choice was inevitable, owing to the intergrada-
tions between the numerous variants. Such a course naturally has led to a large
synonymy for this species as well as others whose leaves were present in large
numbers. As a consequence, however, it follows that the species represented by a
large number of specimens are usually more reliably identified, and long synonymies
01 sueh species tend to add 10 their value for both stratigraphic and purely botanical
purposeS.

In cases where only a few specimens of a given leaf type were obtained in the
collections, the specific identifieations are somewhat less positive. In some cases,
for example, the lack of preservation of some integral portion 01 3 1031 1133 1110-
vented comparison with 301110 previously described species. F 11131 disposition of
such species must 01 necessity await the possibility 01 obtaining larger suites of
more complete specimens.

The generic references of many 01 1110 Medicine Bow species are open to serious
doubt. Unless wholly reliable evidence to the contrary has been obtained, no new
generic names have been substituted 101 111030 previously applied to the species.
In many cases herbarium studies have convinced me that the generic references are
unquestionably incorrect, yet my study of thousands 01 herbarium sheets of other
genera have failed to reveal comparable leaf types. Although older generic refer-
ences are thus retained 101 convenience and for lack of positive evidence for changes
at the present time, it should be understood that such references have little botani-
cal significance and few if any physical conclusions can be drawn from them. It is,
of course, possible that many of the Upper Cretaceous genera have failed to survive
in modern forests. It seems more likely, however, in view of the close similarity
01 301110 01 1110 leaves and seeds to modern forms, that a continued search among
modern plants will ultimately bring out the true botanic relationships. The few
remains 01 300013 obtained in the collections have thus far been stubbornly unidenti-
fiable, or at best determined only within a limit 01 6 10 3 dozen generic possibilities.
Possibly future determinations of petrified wood and speres may open the way to
unsuspected relationships.

In most of the generic references previously made by other writers, their
temperate zone experience has been clearly manifest. The Medicine Bow flora
contains a number 01 distinetly warm temperate and subtropical elements, and
most of the genera suggested as alternatives to present references are 01 low latitude
families. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly evident that a better acquaintance
with more southerly forests will be necessary to a proper taxonomic study 01 1110
103311 species. During the winter of 1931, I spent 3 months in the West Indies
and South and Central America studying the modern forests with Dr. Ralph W.
Chaney 01 1110 University of California, under the auspices of the Carnegie Institu-
tion of Washington. Î™ have planned to extend these studies northward into Mexico
and the Gulf states during the coming year. It is hoped that these experiences
will lead materially to a better understanding of both the taxonomy and the
ecology of the late Cretaeeous floras of the Rocky Mountain region.
