COMPOSITION OF THE FLORA

SYSTEMATIC RELATIONSHIPS

The flora of the lower Medicine Bow formation, as here described, comprises
64 recognizable forms. Of these, 47 are referred to species previously described by
others, 11 are described as new species, and 6 are recorded as not specifically deter-
minable. The various divisions of the plant kingdom are represented as follows:
Dicotyledonae, 45 species; Monocotyledonae, 8 species; Coniferales, 2 species ;
Equisetales, 1 species; FilicaleS‚ 3 species; position uncertain, 5 species. Within
most of these divisions, and in particular within the Dicotyledonae, the systematic
allocation to existing genera, and in some cases to familieS, is subject to revision.
As is discussed under each species in the section on Systematic Palaeobotany‚ refer-
ences to modern genera have previously been made on the basis of leaf characters
which in many cases seem only remotely comparable to the designated genera.
Such forms might better have been placed in non-committa] form genera until con-
clusive evidence of their systematic status had been obtained, but are here included
under their assigned names to avoid confusion.

In the following systematic list of species of the lower Medicine Bow flora, the
genera marked with an asterisk are of doubtful botanical significance.
