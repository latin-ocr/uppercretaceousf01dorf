In the Medicine Bow collections there are over 30 fairly complete specimens and several
fragments which could have been either segregated into about a dozen species or combined into a
single species of somewhat variable leaf form. In view of the intergrading characters of these
specimens and their occurrence in great numbers at one horizon of Locality P. 374, I believe it
justifiable to refer them to one species. In the references given above, both Lesquereux and
Knowlton have admitted that many of the species and varieties listed were difficult. if not impossi-
ble, to differentiate from the original specimens, referred at that time to Populus mbr-ascensis.

The reference of these species to the genus Trochodendroz'des rather than Populus is based
upon the greater resemblance of the leaves to those of several trochodendraceous genera and the
occurrence elsewhere of typical seeds and pods of that family in close association with the leaves of
this type. Both Berry and Brown have previously presented adequate evidence for the reference
to Trochodendroides} The fossil specimens from the Medicine Bow formation resemble closely
the leaves of the living Tetracentron chimensis Oliver ² of eastern Asia.

The stratigraphic and geographie distribution of the various species of Trochodendroz'des. as
now conceived, in the Cretaceous and Tertiary deposits of the Rocky Mountain region is still
inadequately known. Trochodendroides nebrascensz's appears to be most abundant in the lower
Denver and lower Medicine Bow formations. Its reported occurrence in the Paskapoo (Fort
Union?) of British Columbia ³ cannot be corroborated because of the lack of figured specimens.
Moreover, the Fort Union age of the beds from which the original type specimens were collected is
difficult to substantiate because of the inadequate description of the locality, which is reported by
Newberry 4 as “Banks of Yellowstone River.'' That the species occurs in the Lance formation is
indicated by U. S. National Museum specimens from the ‘¹ Converse County beds'' which Knowl-
ton tentatively referred to Populus sp.⁵ My own collection from these same beds east of Lance
Creek, Wyoming. contains several leaves which are definitely referable to Trochodendroz'des nebra-
scansis. The species also is present in Ward's collection of leaves from Black Buttes, Wyoming‚
which I have consulted at the U. S. National Museum.⁶

Though somewhat variable in habit, the leaves here referred to Trochodendroides nebrascensis
are consistent in their ovate shape, rounded or obtuse base. toothed margin, and slightly narrowed
and elongate tip. In these respects they can readily be distinguished from the widespread Fort
Union species. Trochodendroides cuneata (Newberry) Berry,⁷ and from others, such as Populus
anomala Ward, P. cordata Newberry. P. craspedodroma Ward, P. ylandvulvzsera Heer, P. nervosa
Newberry, P. newberryf Cockerell. P. richardsoni Heer, and P. speciosa Ward, all of which are
reported from the Fort Union formation. The closest resemblance among Fort Union species is
with P. daphnoqenoides Ward, which 15, however, more narrowly ovate than the average leaf
form of Trochodefndrofides nebrascensis. Pending the final revision of the Fort Union flora by
Dr. R. W. Brown of the U S. Geological Surv ey, no further attempt can be made to clarify the
taxonomic allocation of the numerous leaves of this type.
