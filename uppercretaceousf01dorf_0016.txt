STRATIGRAPHY
SOUTHERN WYOMING

The Medicine Bow formation is an alternating succession of shales, sandstones,
and coal beds resting conformably on the Lewis shale in the Hanna and Carbon
basins of south central Wyoming. The first comprehensive report on this region
was by Veatch.l who designated the formation as “Lower Laramie” on the basis
of stratigraphic position and “the absence of marine fossils'’ For essentially the
same beds Bowen² subsequently proposed the name Medicine Bow formation,
which has since become generally accepted. Regarding the fossils found in the
formation, Bowen wrote as follows:

“The formation contains remains of fresh and brackish water invertebrates, land plants,
and bones of vertebrates. The plants are regarded by F. H. Knowlton as of the same age as the
plants of the Laramie of the Denver Basin. The invertebrates are considered by T. W. Stanton
to belong to the fauna of the Lance formation. The bones belong in part to the ceratopsians, but
no specimens have been found that are sufficiently diagnostic for even generic determination.”

In a later report on the same general region, Dobbin, Bowen, and Hoots ³
described the formation in more detail and included within its lower limits the
“ sandstone beds with a marine fauna of Fox Hills type.'' It is clearly evident from
both Veatch’s and Bowen’s statements as quoted above that this marine sandstone
had previously been excluded from the Medicine Bow formation and regarded as
the upper portion of the Lewis shale. The various interpretations of the late
Cretaceous and early Tertiary deposits of the region are shown in figure 2, which is
compiled from the three reports cited.

The writer's interpretation of the section is presented in the right-hand column
of figure 2. The recognition of the Fox Hills formation between the Lewis and
the Medicine Bow is based upon the occurrence of the Sphenodiscus zone, which is
of restricted Fox Hills age‚4 at numerous localities in the region, and upon the marked
changes in the aggregate lithology of the sequence. Veatch apparently collected no
fossils from these beds, nor did he mention any changes in lithology in the upper
portion of the Lewis formation or the lower portion of the “Lower Laramie.''
Bowen5 reported the presence of a persistent gray sandstone near the top of the
Lewis shale‚ but did not mention the massive, coarse, concretionary sandstones near
the base of the Medicine Bow formation. He apparently collected no fossils from
these units at that time. The subsequent report by Dobbin, Bowen, and Hoots
recorded characteristic Fox Hills species including Sphenodiscus Zenticularis (Owen)
Mcek near the top of their Lewis formation, and “a fcw marine beds with in-
vertebrate fossils of Fox Hills types intercalated in the hasal part'' of the Medicine
Bow formation.G Although they did not recognize thc Fox Hills formation as a
