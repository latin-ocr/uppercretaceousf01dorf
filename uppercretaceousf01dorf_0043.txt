conditions of growth. Equally in harmony 15 the negative evidence of the absence
of the usual 0001 temperate genera and 1110 scarcity of conifers.

CORRELATION

In attempting to establish age relationships between other recorded floras and
that of the lower Medicine Bow formation, three basic assumptions are made.
These assumptions are: (1) that the ›Sphenodiscus zone of the F ox Hills formation
is of 0550011011)ν 1110 same age wherever encountered; (2) that the Tricercztops dino-
saur zone is likewise 0550011011)Γ 001110111110131100115 wherever found3 and (3) that the
Lance, Laramie, and lower Medicine Bow formations are conformable on the
Sphenodz'scus-bearing Fox Hills formation, and, therefore, only slightly younger
than F ox Hills age.

Since none of these assumptions seems, in my opinion, doubtful or unsupported,
the age of the lower Medicine Bow flora is not open to serious question. Its
occurrence in beds lying within 1300 feet conformably above the Splmodsiscus zone
of the F ox Hills formation and 2500-1- 1001 below Triceratops-bearing beds clearly
establishes the upper and lower limits of its time-range. Whether either or both
of· these zones are referred to the Upper Cretaceous or the Paleoeene is immaterial
to the immediate problem 01 001101311011. 111 1110 following analysis, therefore, the
lower Medicine Bow 11013 15 regarded as a standard flora of known stratigraphic
position with which other floras may be advantageously compared or contrasted.

As indicated in table 4, the Medicine Bow plant species of the present report
total 64, of which 14 are either new or represented by specimens insufficient 101
comparison with previously recorded species. The remaining 50 species have been
described or reported in other floras, which are discussed in the order of their
similarity to the Medicine Bow flora.

Laramz'c flora-—It is at once apparent from table 4 that the Laramie flora 1
of the Denver basin, Colorado‚ shows the elosest relationship to 1110 lower Medicine
Bow flora, with 27 species in common. The same conclusion was reached by
Knowlton on the basis of 511101101, undescribed plant collections obtained from
scattered localities in the Medicine Bow formation.2 This close relationship indi-
cated by the floras is amply corroborated by several lines of evidence: (1) Both
the Laramie and the Medicine Bow formatioris occupy the same stratigraphic 11051-
11011 conformably above the Fox Hills formation, which in both sections carries the
diagnostic Spl1.cn0dz'scus‚·³ (2) 110111 formations lie conformably or with only local
disconformity below beds yielding remains 01 Triccratops; (3) in the Medicine Bow
formation the plant remains were obtained from the 113501 1300 feet, which is
approximately 1110 same thickness of beds from which the Laramie plants were
obtained; (4) the fresh-water invertebrate fauna recorded from the Medicine Bow
formation is of essentially the same character as that of the Laramie 101111011011.4
111 my opinion there is thus sufficient unanimity of stratigraphie, pakeontologic,
