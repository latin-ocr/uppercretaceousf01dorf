Dombeyopsz's trivialis has thus far been reported only from the Laramic and the Medicine
Bow formatioris. I am not aware of any other late Cretaceous or early Tertiary occurrences of
leaves which might possibly be the same.

I do not believe that the affinities of this fossil species are with the existing genus Dombeya,
as is indicated in the name Dombeyopsis. The species of Dombeya, in my experience, have in-
variably more acutely lobed leaves with well-defined acute 100111 along their margins. Although
1 have not seen any modern leaves which are preeisely similar to the fossil specics, a closer re-
semblance is seen to the leaves of certain leIenispermaceae: Caeculus (Cebalha) d‘z'verszsolia, C.
carolinum, and AIenispermum canadense, and of the Vitaeeae, particularly Cissus rhombzsolia of
Mexico.

Specimens referable to this species were encountered at 4 of the 6 Medicine Bow loealities,
although they were abundant only at Locality P. 372, where the field collections contained 241
specimens, of which 20 complete or nearly complete samples were collected for study. The
majority of these are of precisely the same size and character as the nearly perfect original type
specimen from Black Buttes, Wyoming.l Since Lesquereux's report, this species has become
known from a number of scattered localities in the late Cretaceous strata of the Roeky Mountain
region. Knowlton has very ably discussed the essential distinguishing features and distribution
of the species and has described fairly adequately its average leaf form.2 In view os the better
and more abundant material in the Medicine Bow collections it seems highly desirable to make
additions and corrections to his description and to attempt to justify the inclusion of the species
listed above as conspecifie with V iburnum maminotum.

Description (Supplementary)—Leaves broadly ovate to obovate, narrowing abruptly above
to a blunt obtusely pointed or a short acuminate tip, narrowing more gradually below 10 an acutely
