In view of the poor exposures in the vieinity of Craig, the measured seetion
given below was taken farther west along the strike, in the dry valley walls of
spring Greek, 24 miles W. 100 N. of Craig. Here the seotion is well exposed in
steeply dipping beds from the Williams Fork formation up through the Lewis,
Fox Hills, Medicine Bow, and Post-“Laramie’' formations. Exact stratigraphic
positions with relation to the units exposed near Craig wereea sily determined by
the persistence of the two massive, fossiliferous sandstones of the F ox Hills above
