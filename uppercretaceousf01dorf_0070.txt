Only 4 specimens in the collections are of this type. None is completely preserved, though
enough is shown to indicate similarity to the figured and type specimens of this species. There is
little I can add to Knowlton's able discussion of its status.l It is present in the Laramie, Denver,
and Medicine Bow formations, and occurs doubtfully in the Mesaverde, Hanna (“ Upper Laramie’'
of Knowlton), and Black Buttes floras.

Ι 0311 offer no suggestions regarding the botanical affinities of this leaf form.

Occurrence—Elk Mountain road, Wyoming, Loc. P. 374.

collection—U. C. Mus. Ρ31., Plesiotype No. 1327.

Ficus cowanensis Knowlton
(Plate 7, Fig. 1)
Ficus comanensis Knowlton, U. S. Geol. Surv, Prof. Paper 130, 139, pl. 8, fig. 6, pl. 9, figs, 2, 3, 1922.

There are several incomplete specimens in the collections which are quite distinct in their
large size, entire margin, obovate—lanceolate shape, extremely thick midrib, and 111111, widely spaced
secondaries. They agree perfectly with the description and type specimens of Ficus comanensis
from the Laramie formation.

This species has never been found completely preserved. Ι suspect that it may ultimately
be found to be the same as some of the leaves usually referred to M aqnolz'a or Laurus, as for exam-
ple, M aqnolz'a leei Knowlton, M. hizyardz'ana Lesquereux, or Laurus? caudata Knowlton.²

Occurrence—Elk Mountain road, Wyoming, Loc. P. 374.

collection—U. C. Mus. Ρ31., No. 1328.

There is a single specimen and its counterpart and many incomplete specimens from Locality
P. 375 which are similar in size and essential details to the type and figured specimens of this
species from the Vermejo formation. The Medicine Bow specimen is somewhat larger than the
figured Vermejo specimen, but is identical with the large, unfigured specimen described by Knowl-
ton from the same formation.

There is nothing to be added at the present time to the accurate description and discussion
of this species by Knowlton. He has already adequately pointed out the superficial resemblance
of this species to several American species of Protophyllum, and its greater similarity to 3 number
of European members of this genus. Comparable types appear to be rare in the late Cretaceous
and early Tertiary of the Rocky Mountains. Hollick has described a number of species of
Credneria and of the related genera Protofflzyllum, Pseudoprotophyllum, and Pseudoaspidiophyllum
from the Cretaceous 01 Alaska.³ Most of these are represented by large leaves with the same
