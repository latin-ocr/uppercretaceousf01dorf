01 1115 Goshen flora, the Bridge Creek flora, the modern flora of the Muir Woods,
California, the modern Panama fiora‚1 the Eocene VVeaverville flora 01 03111011113,2
and the Upper Cretaceous Laramie flora 01 Colorado.

In compiling table 2, I have used a somewhat different arrangement from
that 01 Chaney and Sanborn, and of MacGinitie. The characters 01 margin, length,
and nervation are placed in the first three columns, as they are considered more
reliable and more diagnostic than the remaining characters. There are two reasons
101 50 considering them: (1) these characters have been tested more fully in modern
forests, chiefly by Bailey and Sinnott; (2) they are more readily and more accu-
rately determinable in 105511 leaves than are the remaining characters. A quan-
titative determination 01 texture in 105511 leaves is somewhat more difficult, since
it involves a considerable amount 01 personal opinion. Likewise in organization,
it is often impossible to ascertain whether a 105511 1531 15 actually a simple leaf or
a leaflet 01 3 compound leaf. It 15 usually necessary in this category to resort to
comparisons 01 1115 105511 leaves with modern correlatives, a procedure which com-
pletely defeats the purpose 01 11115 study, namely to make climatic inferences which
shall check and supplement the inferences made on the basis of taxonomy and
modern distribution 01 correlatives. The presence or absence of dripping point
has not yet been statistically studied in a sufficient number 01 modern forests to
be reliably used. It has been my experience, moreover, that it is often a matter
01 opinion as to just how abrupt and elongate a leaf tip must be to be considered
a dripping point. Ι have also been forced to consider dripping points absent from
many 105511 1531 5050155 merely because the tip was not preserved, a condition which
actually may have resulted from the very presence 01 3 fragile, easily destroyed
dripping point.
