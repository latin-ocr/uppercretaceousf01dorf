Asplenium martini Knowlton, U. S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Paper 130, 111, pl. 2, fig. 6, 1922.

Two well-preserved specimens and one fragment are clearlyidentical with the figured and type
specimens of Asplenium? coloradense Knowlton from the Vermejo formation of Colorado. The
shapc and disposition of the pinnules are precisely as in Knowlton's figure 2, and the venation is
the same, consisting of about eight or nine pairs of veins which fork once just above the midvcin.

Knowlton has previously included in this species the specimens from Rockvale, Colorado
which Hollick had regarded as Asplem'um maynu'm Knowlton. This seems clearly justifiablc.
It is not possible, moreover, to distinguish this species from Asplenium martini Knowlton from the
Laramie of Colorado. Although pointing out its close relationship, Knowlton maintained this as
a separate species on the basis of “its larger size, more obtuse pinnules, and much stronger vena-
‘ciens’ ¹ In view of the variation shown in the shapes of the pinnules of Asplem‘um? coloraclense
Knowlton, with those near the base being larger and more obtuse than the rest, and the identity
of the venation, it seems impossible not to include all of these specimens in the single species
which has priority. The generic reference is still open to question, pending the discovery of at-
tached fructificatione.

Occurrence—Corson Ranch, Wyoming, Loc. P. 371.

Collection—U. C. Mus. Pal„ Plcsiotypes Nos. 1289, 1394.

Genus DRYOPTERIS Andanson
Dryopteris‘? carbonensis Knowlton
(Plate 1, Figs. 3-7)
Dryoptcrz's? carbonensis Knowlton‚ U. S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Paper 130, 110, pl. 20, figs. 3—5, 1922.

This form is represented by seven specimens, five of which are figured. Most of the speci-
mens are fragmentary or poorly preserved. The general form, size, and disposition of the pinnules,
however, is adequately shown in figure 6; details of the venation appear in figure 7.

In all observable features these specimens are indistinguishable from the figures and type
specimens of this Laramie species. The details of the venation are somewhat better preserved
than in Knowlton's specimens, indicating, as he intimated‚ that some of the finer veins are once-
forked near the midvein.

Knowlton has previously recorded ² the presence of this species in the Medicine Bow forma-
tion in a manuscript list based on eollections at the U. S. National Museum. Unclassified speci-
mens (Nos. 590, a, b, c, e) of similar pinnules have been identified in the collections from Black
Buttes, Wyoming, which Ι have consulted at the U. S. National Museum.

There is no positive evidence for the reference of this species to the genus Dryopteris, except
a general resemblance in shape, size, and venation of pinnules. A more definite allocation cannot
be made without better material and associated fertile sronds.

Occurrence—Corson Ranch, Wyoming, Loc. P. 371.

Collection—U. C. Mus. Pal„ Plesiotypes Nos. 1290, 1291, 1395, 1396, 1397.
